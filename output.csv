106,Momentum + Keltner Stochastic Combo),the momentumkeltnerstochastic combination strategy a technical analysis and empirical validationthis study presents an advanced algorithmic trading strategy that implements a hybrid approach between momentumbased price dynamics and relative positioning within a volatilityadjusted keltner channel framework the strategy utilizes an innovative keltner stochastic concept as its primary decisionmaking factor for market entries and exits while implementing a dynamic capital allocation model with riskbased stoploss mechanisms empirical testing demonstrates the strategys potential for generating alpha in various market conditions through the combination of trendfollowing momentum principles and meanreversion elements within defined volatility thresholds1 introductionfinancial market trading increasingly relies on the integration of various technical indicators for identifying optimal trading opportunities lo et al 2000 while individual indicators are often compromised by market noise combinations of complementary approaches have shown superior performance in detecting significant market movements murphy 1999 kaufman 2013 this research introduces a novel algorithmic strategy that synthesizes momentum principles with volatilityadjusted envelope analysis through keltner channels2 theoretical foundation21 momentum componentthe momentum component of the strategy builds upon the seminal work of jegadeesh and titman 1993 who demonstrated that stocks which performed well poorly over a 3 to 12month period continue to perform well poorly over subsequent months as moskowitz et al 2012 further established this timeseries momentum effect persists across various asset classes and time frames the present strategy implements a shortterm momentum lookback period 7 bars to identify the prevailing price direction consistent with findings by chan et al 2000 that shorterterm momentum signals can be effective in algorithmic trading systems22 keltner channelskeltner channels as formalized by chester keltner 1960 and later modified by linda bradford raschke represent a volatilitybased envelope system that plots bands at a specified distance from a central exponential moving average keltner 1960 raschke connors 1996 unlike traditional bollinger bands that use standard deviation keltner channels typically employ average true range atr to establish the bands distance from the central line providing a smoother volatility measure as established by wilder 197823 stochastic oscillator principlesthe strategy incorporates a modified stochastic oscillator approach conceptually similar to lanes stochastic lane 1984 but applied to a prices position within keltner channels rather than standard price ranges this creates what we term keltner stochastic measuring the relative position of price within the volatilityadjusted channel as a percentage value3 strategy methodology31 entry and exit conditionsthe

107,Prop Firm Business Simulator,the prop firm business simulator is exactly what it sounds like its a plug and play tool to test out any tradingview strategy and simulate hypothetical performance on cfd prop firmsnow what is a modern day cfd prop firmthese companies sell simulated trading challenges for a challenge fee if you complete the challenge you get access to simulated capital and you get a portion of the profits you make on those accounts payed outive included some popular firms in the code as presets so its easy to simulate them take into account that this info will likely be out of date soon as these prices and challenge conditions changealso this tool will never be able to 100 simulate prop firm conditions and all their rules all i aim to do with this tool is provide estimationsnow why is this tool helpfulmost traders on here want to turn their passion into their fulltime career prop firms have lately been the buzz in the trading community and market themselves as a faster way to reach that goal while this all sounds great on paper it is sometimes hard to estimate how much money you will have to burn on challenge fees and set realistic monthly payout expectations for yourself and your trading this is where this tool comes inive specifically developed this for traders that want to treat prop firms as a business and as a business you want to know your monthly costs and income depending on the trading strategy and prop firm challenge you are usinghow to use this toolits quite simple you remove the top part of the script and replace it with your

will then use the strategy equity of your own strategy and use this to simulat prop firms since these cfd prop firms work with different phases and payouts the indicator will simulate the gains until target or max drawdown daily drawdown limit gets reached if it reaches target it will go to the next phase and keep on doing that until it fails a challenge if in one of the phases there is a reward for completing like a payout refund extra it will add this to the gains if you fail the challenge by reaching max drawdown or daily drawdown limit it will substract the challenge fee from the gainsthese gains are then visualised in the calendar so you can get an idea of yearly monthly gains of the backtest remember it is just a backtest so no guarantees of future incomethe bottom pane nonoverlay is visualising the performance of the backtest during the phases this way u can check if it is realistic for instance if it only takes 1 bar on chart to reach target you are probably risking more than the firm wants you to risk also it becomes much less clear if daily drawdown got hit in those high risk strategies the results will be less accuratethe daily drawdown limit gets reset every time there is a new dayofweek on chartif you set your prop firm preset setting to custom the settings below that are applied as your prop firm settings otherwise it will use one of the template by default its ftmo 100kthe strategy im using as an example in this script is a simple keltner channel breakout strategy im using a 005 commission per trade as that is what i found most common on crypto exchanges and its close to the commissionsspread you get on a cfd prop firm im targeting a 1 risk per trade in the backtest to try and stay within prop firm boundaries of max 1 risk per tradelastly the original yearly and monthly performance table was developed by quantnomad and ive build ontop of that code heres a link to the original publicationhttpswwwtradingviewcomscriptkzp8e4x3monthlyreturnsinpinescriptstrategiesthats everything for now hope this indicator helps people visualise the potential of prop firms better or to

111,TASC 2025.05 Trading The Channel,overviewthis script implements channelbased trading strategies based on the concepts explained by perry j kaufman in the article a test of three approaches trading the channel from the may 2025 edition of tascs traders tips the script explores three distinct trading methods for equities and futures using information from a linear regression channel each rule set corresponds to different market behaviors offering flexibility for trendfollowing breakout and meanreversion trading styles conceptslinear regressionlinear regression is a model that estimates the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line to the observed data in the context of financial time series traders often use linear regression to estimate trends in price movements over time the slope of the linear regression line indicates the strength and direction of the price trend for example a larger positive slope indicates a stronger upward trend and a larger negative slope indicates the opposite traders can look for shifts in the direction of a linear regression slope to identify potential trend trading signals and they can analyze the magnitude of the slope to support trading decisions one caveat to linear regression is that most financial time series data does not follow a straight line meaning a regression line cannot perfectly describe the relationships between values prices typically fluctuate around a regression line to some degree as such analysts often project ranges above and below regression lines creating channels to model the expected extent of the datas variability this strategy constructs a channel based on the method used in kaufmans article it measures the maximum distances from points on the linear regression line to historical price values then adds those distances and the current slope to the regression points depending on the trading style traders might look for prices to move outside an established channel for breakout signals or they might look for price action to reach extremes within the channel for potential mean reversion opportunities strategy calculationsprimary trade rulesthis strategy implements three distinct sets of rules for trend breakout and meanreversion trades based on the methods kaufman describes in his articletrade the trend rule 1 open new positions when the sign of the slope changes indicating a potential trend reversal close short trades and enter a long trade when the slope changes from negative to positive and do the opposite when the slope changes from positive to negative trade channel breakouts rule 2 open new positions when prices cross outside the linear regression channel for the current sample close short trades and enter a long trade when the price moves above the channel and do the opposite when the price moves below the channel trade within the channel rule 3 open new positions based on price values within the channels range close short trades and enter a long trade when the price is near the channels low within a specified percentage of the channels range and do the opposite when the price is near the channels high with this rule users can also filter the trades based on the channels slope when the filter is active long positions are allowed only when the slope is positive and short positions are allowed only when it is negative position sizingkaufmans strategy uses specific trade sizes for equities and futures marketsfor an equities symbol the number of shares traded is 10000 divided by the current pricefor a futures symbol the number of contracts traded is based on a volatilityadjusted formula that divides 25000 by the product of the 20bar average true range and the instruments point value by default this script automatically uses these sizes for its trade simulation on equities and futures symbols and does not simulate trading on other symbols however users can control position sizes from the settingsproperties tab and enable trade simulation on other symbol types by selecting the manual option in the scripts position sizing input stoplossthis strategy includes the option to place an accompanying stoploss order for each trade which users can enable from the sl input in the settingsinputs tab when enabled the strategy places a stoploss order at a specified percentage distance from the closing price where the entry order occurs allowing users to compare how the strategy performs with added loss protection usagethis strategy adapts its display logic for the three trading approaches based on the rule selected in the trade rule inputfor all rules the script plots the linear regression slope in a separate pane the plot is colorcoded to indicate whether the current slope is positive or negative when the selected rule is trade the trend the script plots triangles in the separate pane to indicate when the slopes direction changes from positive to negative or vice versa additionally it plots a colorcoded sma on the main chart pane allowing visual comparison of the slope to directional changes in a moving averagewhen the rule is trade channel breakouts or trade within the channel the script draws the current periods linear regression channel on the main chart pane and it plots bands representing the history of the channel values from the specified start time onward when the rule is trade within the channel the script plots overbought and oversold zones between the bands based on a userspecified percentage of the channel range to indicate the value ranges where new trades are allowedusers can customize the strategys calculations with the following additional inputs in the settingsinputs tabstart date sets the date and time when the strategy begins simulating trades the script marks the specified point on the chart with a gray vertical line the plots for rules 2 and 3 display the bands and trading zones from this point onward period specifies the number of bars in the linear regression channel calculation the default is 40 linreg source specifies the source series from which to calculate the linear regression values the default is closerange source specifies whether the script uses the distances from the linear regression line to closing prices or high and low prices to determine the channels upper and lower ranges for rules 2 and 3 the default is closezone the percentage of the channels overall range to use for trading zones with rule 3 the default is 20 meaning the width of the upper and lower zones is 20 of the range sl if the checkbox is selected the strategy adds a stoploss to each trade at the specified percentage distance away from the closing price where the entry order occurs the checkbox is deselected by default and the default percentage value is 5 position sizing determines whether the strategy uses kaufmans predefined trade sizes auto or allows userdefined sizes from

113,Weighted Ichimoku Strategy,hsba the ichimoku kinko hyo indicator is a comprehensive tool that combines multiple signals to identify market trends and potential buyingselling opportunities my weighted variant of this strategy attempts to assign specific weights to each signal allowing for a more nuanced and customizable approach to trend identification the intent is to try and make a more informed trading decision based on the cumulative strength of various signalsive tried not to make it a mishmash of this and that macd rsi and on and on most people have their preferred indicator that focuses on just that that they can use in conjunctionthe signals used can be grouped into two groups the core ichimoku signals the additional signals at the end you will find the signals and their assigned weights followed by the thresholds where they alignthe core ichimoku signals are the primary signals used in ichimoku analysis including kumo breakout chikou cross kijun cross tenkan cross and kumo twistwhile the additional signals provide further insights and confirmations such as kijun confirmation tenkankijun above cloud chikou above cloud pricekijun cross chikou span signal and price positioningentries are triggered when the cumulative weight of bullish signals exceeds a specified buy threshold indicating a strong uptrend or potential trend reversalexits are initiated when the cumulative weight of bearish signals surpasses a specified sell threshold or when additional conditions such as consolidation patterns or atrbased targets are methttpswwwtradingviewcomxpkqrqk4dthere are various exit types that you can choose between which can be used separately or in conjunction with one another as an example you might want to exit on a different condition during consolidation periods than during other periods or just use atr with some other backstop they are listed in evaluation order ie atr trumps all consolidation exit trumps the regular kumo sell and so on atr sell exits trades based on atrbased profit targets and stoplosses consolidation exit exits trades during consolidation periods to reduce drawdown sell below kumo exits trades when the price is below the kumo indicating a potential downtrend sell threshold exits trades when the cumulative weight of bearish signals surpasses a specified sell thresholdthere are various filters which are really behavior modifiers kumo breakout filter requires price to close above the kumo for buy signals essentially a entry delay whipsaw filter ensures trend strength over specified days to reduce false signals buy cooldown prevents new entries until half the kijun period passes after an exit prevents flapping chikou filter delays exits unless the previous close is below the chikou span consolidation trend filter prevents consolidation exits if the trend is bullish rare but happensthen there are some debugging options ichimoku periods have some presets personally i like 8224422 but are freely configurable preset to the traditional values for puriststhe list of signals and most thresholds follow play around with them thats all cheers core ichimoku signals kumo breakout 30 bullish 30 bearish indicates a strong trend when the price breaks above bullish or below bearish the kumo cloud this signal suggests a significant shift in market sentiment chikou cross 20 bullish 20 bearish shows the relationship between the chikou span lagging span and the current price a bullish signal occurs when the chikou span is above the price indicating a potential uptrend conversely a bearish signal occurs when the chikou span is below the price suggesting a downtrend kijun cross 15 bullish 15 bearish signals trend changes when the tenkansen conversion line crosses above bullish or below bearish the kijunsen base line this crossover is often used to identify potential trend reversals tenkan cross 10 bullish 10 bearish indicates shortterm trend changes when the price crosses above bullish or below bearish the tenkansen this signal helps identify minor trend shifts within the broader trend kumo twist 5 bullish 5 bearish shows changes in the kumos direction indicating potential trend shifts a bullish kumo twist occurs when senkou span a crosses above senkou span b and a bearish twist occurs when senkou span a crosses below senkou span b additional signals kijun confirmation 8 bullish 8 bearish confirms the trend based on the prices position relative to the kijunsen a bullish signal occurs when the price is above the kijunsen and a bearish signal occurs when the price is below it tenkankijun above cloud 5 bullish 5 bearish indicates a strong bullish trend when both the tenkansen and kijunsen are above the kumo conversely a bearish signal occurs when both lines are below the kumo chikou above cloud 5 bullish 5 bearish shows the chikou spans position relative to the kumo indicating trend strength a bullish signal occurs when the chikou span is above the kumo and a bearish signal occurs when it is below pricekijun cross 2 bullish 2 bearish signals shortterm trend changes when the price crosses above bullish or below bearish the kijunsen this signal is similar to the kijun cross but focuses on the prices direct interaction with the kijunsen chikou span signal 10 bullish 10 bearish indicates the trend based on the chikou spans position relative to past price highs and lows a bullish signal occurs when the chikou span is above the highest high of the past period and a bearish signal occurs when it is below the lowest low price positioning 10 bullish 10 bearish shows indecision when the price is between the tenkansen and kijunsen indicating a potential consolidation phase a bullish signal occurs when the price is

136,Z-Score Normalized VIX Strategy,this strategy leverages the concept of the zscore applied to multiple vixbased volatility indices specifically designed to capture market reversals based on the normalization of volatility the strategy takes advantage of vixrelated indicators to measure extreme levels of market fear or greed and adjusts its position accordingly1 overview of the zscore methodologythe zscore is a statistical measure that describes the position of a value relative to the mean of a distribution in terms of standard deviations in this strategy the zscore is calculated for various volatility indices to assess how far their values are from their historical averages thus normalizing volatility levels the zscore is calculated as followsz fracx musigmawhere x is the current value of the volatility index mu is the mean of the index over a specified period sigma is the standard deviation of the index over the same periodthis measure tells us how many standard deviations the current value of the index is away from its average indicating whether the market is experiencing unusually high or low volatility fear or calm2 vix indices used in the strategythe strategy utilizes four commonly referenced volatility indices vix cboe volatility index measures the markets expectations of 30day volatility based on sp 500 options vix3m 3month vix reflects expectations of volatility over the next three months vix9d 9day vix reflects shorterterm volatility expectations vvix vix of vix measures the volatility of the vix itself indicating the level of uncertainty in the volatility indexthese indices provide a comprehensive view of the current volatility landscape across different time horizons3 strategy logicthe strategy follows a long entry condition and an exit condition based on the combined zscore of the selected volatility indices long entry condition the strategy enters a long position when the combined zscore of the selected vix indices falls below a userdefined threshold indicating an abnormally low level of volatility suggesting a potential market bottom and a bullish reversal the threshold is set as a negative value eg 1 where a more negative zscore implies greater deviation below the mean exit condition the strategy exits the long position when the combined zscore exceeds the threshold ie when the market volatility increases above the threshold indicating a shift in market sentiment and reduced likelihood of continued upward momentum4 user inputs zscore lookback period the user can adjust the lookback period for calculating the zscore eg 6 periods zscore threshold a customizable threshold value to define when the market has reached an extreme volatility level triggering entries and exitsthe strategy also allows users to select which vix indices to use with checkboxes to enable or disable each index in the calculation of the combined zscore5 trade execution parameters initial capital the strategy assumes an initial capital of 20000 pyramiding the strategy does not allow pyramiding multiple positions in the same direction commission and slippage the commission is set at 005 per contract and slippage is set at 1 tick6 statistical basis of the zscore approachthe zscore methodology is a standard technique in statistics and finance commonly used in risk management and for identifying outliers or unusual events according to dumas fleming and whaley 1998 volatility indices like the vix serve as a useful proxy for market sentiment particularly during periods of high uncertainty by calculating the zscore we normalize volatility and quantify the degree to which the current volatility deviates from historical norms allowing for systematic entry and exit based on these deviations7 implications of the strategythis strategy aims to exploit market conditions where volatility has deviated significantly from its historical mean when the zscore falls below the threshold it suggests that the market has become excessively calm potentially indicating an overreaction to past market events entering long positions under such conditions could capture market reversals as fear subsides and volatility normalizes conversely when the zscore rises above the threshold it signals increased volatility which could be indicative of a bearish shift in the market prompting an exit from the positionby applying this zscore normalized approach the strategy seeks to achieve more consistent entry and exit points by reducing reliance on subjective interpretation of market conditions8

139,EMA Crossover (Short Focus with Trailing Stop),this strategy utilizes a combination of exponential moving averages ema and simple moving averages sma to generate entry and exit signals for both long and short positions the core of the strategy is based on the 13period ema short ema crossing the 33period ema long ema for entering long trades while a 13period ema crossing the 25period ema mid ema generates short trade signals the 100period sma and 200period sma serve as additional trend indicators to provide context for the market conditions the strategy aims to capitalize on trend reversals and momentum shifts in the marketthe strategy is designed to execute trades swiftly with an emphasis on entering positions when conditions align in real time for long entries the strategy initiates a buy when the 13 ema is greater than the 33 ema indicating a bullish trend for short entries the 13 ema crossing below the 33 ema signals a bearish trend prompting a short position importantly the code includes builtin exit conditions for both long and short positions long positions are exited when the 13 ema falls below the 33 ema while short positions are closed when the 13 ema crosses above the 25 emaa key feature of the strategy is the use of trailing stops for both long and short positions this dynamic exit method adjusts the stop level as the market moves in favor of the trade locking in profits while reducing the risk of losses the trailing stop for long positions is based on the high price of the current bar while the trailing stop for short positions is set using the low price providing more flexibility in managing risk this trailing stop mechanism helps to capture profits from favorable market moves while ensuring that positions are exited if the market moves against themthis strategy works best on the daily timeframe and is optimized for major cryptocurrency pairs the daily chart allows for the emas to provide more reliable signals as the strategy is designed to capture broader trends rather than shortterm market fluctuations using it on major crypto pairs increases its effectiveness as these assets tend to have strong and sustained trends providing better opportunities for the strategy to perform well,"{'Portfolio management', 'Trend Analysis', 'Moving Averages'}",False,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True

its confirmation to as little as possible while avoiding repaintingimmediate detection mode still uses the pivots detection model to find the first highlow of a divergence however the most recent

217,Non-Repainting Renko Emulation Strategy [PineIndicators],introduction the repainting problem in renko strategiesrenko charts are widely used in technical analysis for their ability to filter out market noise and emphasize price trends unlike traditional candlestick charts which are based on fixed time intervals renko charts construct bricks only when price moves by a predefined amount this makes them useful for trend identification while reducing small fluctuationshowever renkobased trading strategies often fail in live trading due to a fundamental issue repaintingwhy do renko strategies repaintmost trading platforms including tradingview generate renko charts retrospectively based on historical price data this leads to the following issues renko bricks can change or disappear when new data arrives backtesting results do not reflect real market conditions strategies may appear highly profitable in backtests because historical data is recalculated with hindsight live trading produces different results than backtesting traders cannot know in advance whether a new renko brick will form until price moves far enoughobjective of the renko emulatorthis script simulates renko behavior on a standard timebased chart without repainting instead of using tradingviews builtin renko charting which recalculates past bricks this approach ensures that once a renko brick is formed it remains unchangedkey benefits no past bricks are recalculated or removed trading strategies can execute reliably without false signals renkobased logic can be applied on a timebased charthow the renko emulator works1 parameter configuration initializationthe script defines key user inputs and variablesbricksize defines the renko brick size in price points adjustable by the userrenkoprice stores the closing price of the last completed renko brickprevrenkoprice stores the price level of the previous renko brickbrickdir tracks the direction of renko bricks 1 up 1 downnewbrick a boolean flag that indicates whether a new renko brick has been formedbrickstart stores the bar index at which the current renko brick started2 identifying renko brick formation without repaintingto ensure that the strategy does not repaint renko calculations are performed only on confirmed bars the script calculates the difference between the current price and the last renko brick level if the absolute price difference meets or exceeds the brick size a new renko brick is formed the new renko price level is updated based on the number of bricks that would fit within the price movement the direction brickdir is updated and a flag newbrick is set to indicate that a new brick has been formed3 visualizing renko bricks on a timebased chartsince tradingview does not support live renko charts without repainting the script uses graphical elements to draw renkostyle bricks on a standard charteach time a new renko brick forms a colored rectangle box is drawngreen boxes represent bullish renko bricksred boxes represent bearish renko bricksthis allows traders to see renkolike formations on a timebased chart while ensuring that past bricks do not changetrading strategy implementationsince the renko emulator provides a stable price structure it is possible to apply a consistent trading strategy that would otherwise fail on a traditional renko chart1 entry conditionsa long trade is entered when the previous renko brick was bearish the new renko brick confirms an upward trend there is no existing long positiona short trade is entered when the previous renko brick was bullish the new renko brick confirms a downward trend there is no existing short position2 exit conditionstrades are closed when a trend reversal is detected long trades are closed when a new bearish brick forms short trades are closed when a new bullish brick formskey characteristics of this approach1 no historical recalculation once a renko brick forms it remains fixed and does not change past price action does not shift based on future data2 trading strategies operate consistently since the renko structure is stable strategies can execute without unexpected changes in signals live trading results align more closely with backtesting performance3 allows renko analysis without switching chart types traders can apply renko logic without leaving a standard timebased chart this enables integration with indicators that normally cannot be used on traditional renko chartsconsiderations when using this strategy trade execution may be delayed compared to standard renko charts since new bricks are only confirmed on closed bars entries may occur slightly later brick size selection is important a smaller bricksize results in more frequent trades while a larger bricksize reduces signalsconclusionthis renko emulation strategy provides a method for using renkobased trading strategies on a timebased chart without repainting by ensuring that bricks do not change once formed it allows traders to use stable renko logic while avoiding the issues associated with traditional renko chartsthis approach enables accurate backtesting and reliable live execution making it suitable for trendfollowing and swing trading strategies that rely on renko price action,"{'repaint', 'renko', 'strategy', 'Trend Analysis',

247,  [3Commas] HA & MA,ha ma what it does this tool is designed to test a trendfollowing strategy using heikin ashi candles and moving averages it enters trades after pullbacks aiming to let profits run once the risktoreward ratio reaches 11 while securing the positionwho is it for it is ideal for traders looking to compare final results using fixed versus dynamic take profits by adjusting parameters and trade directiona concept applicable to most trading strategieshow does it work we use moving averages to define the market trend then wait for opposite heikin ashi candles to form against it once these candles reverse in favor of the trend we enter the trade using the last swing created by the pullback as the stop loss by applying the breakeven ratio we protect the trade and let it run using the slower moving average as a trailing stopa buy signal is generated whenthe previous candle is bearish ha_bear1 indicating a pullbackthe fast moving average ma1 is above the slow

confirming entries with both heikin ashi and real price action supported by moving average alignment to avoid false signalsif the price reaches a 11 risktoreward ratio the stop will be moved to the entry point however if the slow moving average surpasses this level it will become the new exit point acting as a trailing stopwhy its unique easily visualizes the benefits of using risktoreward

trend has likely became stronger combination of ao and ac is used for creating socalled trading zones to create the signals while alligator and fractal are used in conjunction as an approximation of shortterm trend to filter them at the same time ema default emas period 100 is used as high probability longterm trend filter to open long trades only if it considers current price action as an uptrend more information in methodology and justification of methodology paragraphs the strategy opens only long tradesunique featuresno fixed stoploss and take profit instead of fixed stoploss level strategy utilizes technical condition obtained by fractals and alligator to identify when current uptrend is likely to be over in some special cases strategy uses ao and ac combination to trail profit more information in methodology and justification of methodology paragraphsconfigurable trading periods users can tailor the strategy to specific market windows adapting to different market conditionsmultilayer trades opening system strategy uses only 10 of capital in every trade and open up to 5 trades at the same time if script consider current trend as strong oneshort and long term trend trade filters strategy uses ema as high probability longterm trend filter and alligator and fractal combination as a shortterm onemethodologythe strategy opens long trade when the following price met the conditions1 price closed above ema by default period 100 crossover is not obligatory2 combination of alligator and williams fractals shall consider current trend as an upward all details in justification of methodology paragraph3 both ac and ao shall print two consecutive increasing values at the price candle close which corresponds to this condition algorithm opens the first long trade with 10 of capital4 if combination of alligator and williams fractals shall consider current trend has been changed from up to downtrend all long trades will be closed no matter how many trades has been opened5 if ao and ac both continue printing the rising values strategy opens the long trade on each candle close with 10 of capital while number of opened trades reaches 5 6 if ao and ac both has printed 5 rising values in a row algorithm close all trades if candles low below the low of the 5th candle with rising ao and ac values in a rowscript also has additional visuals if second long trade has been opened simultaneously the alligators teeth line is plotted with the green color also for every trade in a row from 2 to 5 the label buy more is also plotted just below the teeth line with every next simultaneously opened trade the green color of the space between teeth and price became less transparentstrategy settingsin the inputs window user can setup strategy setting ema length by default 100 period of ema used for longterm trend filtering ema calculation user can choose the optimal parameters during backtesting on certain price chartjustification of methodologylets explore the key concepts of this strategy and understand how they work together well begin with the simplest the emathe exponential moving average ema is a type of moving average that assigns greater weight to recent price data making it more responsive to current market changes compared to the simple moving average sma this tool is widely used in technical analysis to identify trends and generate buy or sell signals the ema is calculated as follows1calculate the smoothing multipliermultiplier 2 n 1 where n is the number of periods2 ema calculationema current price multiplier previous ema 1 multiplierin this strategy the ema acts as a longterm trend filter for instance long trades are considered only when the price closes above the ema default 100period this increases the likelihood of entering trades aligned with the prevailing trendnext lets discuss the shortterm trend filter which combines the williams alligator and williams fractals williams alligatordeveloped by bill williams the alligator is a technical indicator that identifies trends and potential market reversals it consists of three smoothed moving averagesjaw blue line the slowest of the three based on a 13period smoothed moving average shifted 8 bars aheadteeth red line the mediumspeed line derived from an 8period smoothed moving average shifted 5 bars forwardlips green line the fastest line calculated using a 5period smoothed moving average shifted 3 bars forwardwhen the lines diverge and align in order the alligator is awake signaling a strong trend when the lines overlap or intertwine the alligator is asleep indicating a rangebound or sideways market this indicator helps traders determine when to enter or avoid tradesfractals another tool by bill williams help identify potential reversal points on a price chart a fractal forms over at least five consecutive bars with the middle bar showing eitherup fractal occurs when the middle bar has a higher high than the two preceding and two following bars suggesting a potential downward reversaldown fractal happens when the middle bar shows a lower low than the surrounding two bars hinting at a possible upward reversaltraders often use fractals alongside other indicators to confirm trends or reversals enhancing decisionmaking accuracyhow do these tools work together in this strategy lets consider an example of an uptrendwhen the price breaks above an up fractal it signals a potential bullish trend this occurs because the up fractal represents a shift in market behavior where a temporary high was formed due to selling pressure if the price revisits this level and breaks through it suggests the market sentiment has turned bullishthe breakout must occur above the alligators teeth line to confirm the trend a breakout below the teeth is considered invalid and the downtrend might still persist conversely in a downtrend the same logic applies with down fractalsin this strategy if the most recent up fractal breakout occurs above the alligators teeth and follows the last down fractal breakout below the teeth the algorithm identifies an uptrend long trades can be opened during this phase if a signal aligns if the price breaks a down fractal below the teeth line during an uptrend the strategy assumes the uptrend has ended and closes all open long tradesby combining the ema as a longterm trend filter with the alligator and fractals as shortterm filters this approach increases the likelihood of opening profitable trades while staying aligned with market dynamicsnow lets talk about the trading zones concept and its signals to understand this we need to briefly introduce what is ao and ac the awesome oscillator ao developed by bill williams is a momentum indicator designed to measure market momentum by contrasting recent price movements with a longerterm historical perspective it helps traders detect potential trend reversals and assess the strength of ongoing trendsthe formula for ao is as followsao sma5median price sma34median pricewheremedian price high low 2sma5 5period simple moving average of the median pricesma 34 34period simple moving average of the median pricethe accelerationdeceleration ac indicator introduced by bill williams measures the rate of change in market momentum it highlights shifts in the driving force of price movements and helps traders spot early signs of trend changes the ac indicator is particularly useful for identifying whether the current momentum is accelerating or decelerating which can indicate potential reversals or continuations for ac calculation we shall use the ao calculated above is the following formulaac ao sma5ao where sma5aois the 5period simple moving average of the awesome oscillatorwhen the ac is above the zero line and rising it suggests accelerating upward momentumwhen the ac is below the zero line and falling it indicates accelerating downward momentumwhen the ac is below zero line and rising it suggests the decelerating the downtrend momentum when ac is above the zero line and falling it suggests the decelerating the uptrend momentumnow lets discuss the trading zones concept and how it can create the signal zones are created by the combination of ao and ac we can divide three zone typesgreed zone when the ao and ac both are rising red zone when the ao and ac both are decreasing gray zone when one of ao or ac is rising the other is fallinggray zone is considered as uncertainty ac and ao are moving in the opposite direction strategy skip such price action to decrease the chance to stuck in the losing trade during potential sideways red zone is also not interesting for the algorithm because both indicators consider the trend as bearish but strategy opens only long trades it is waiting for the green zone to increase the chance to open trade in the direction of the potential uptrend when we have 2 candles in a row in the green zone script executes a long trade with 10 of capitaltwo green zone candles in a row is considered by algorithm as a bullish trend but now so strong thats the reason why trade is going to be closed when the combination of alligator and fractals will consider the the trend change from bullish to bearish if id did not happens algorithm starts to count the green zone candles in a row when we have 5 in a row script change the trade closing condition such situation is considered is a high probability strong bull market and all trades will be closed if candles low will be lower than fifth green zone candles low this is used to increase probability to secure the profit if long trades are initiated the strategy continues utilizing subsequent signals until the total number of trades reaches a maximum of 5 each trade uses 10 of capital why we use trading zones signals if currently strategy algorithm considers the high probability of the shortterm uptrend with the alligator and fractals combination pointed out above and the longterm trend is also suggested by the ema filter as bullish rising ac and ao values in the direction of the most likely main trend signaling that we have the high probability of the fastest bullish phase on the market the main idea is to take part in such rapid moves and add trades if this move continues its acceleration according to indicators backtest resultsoperating window

249,Boilerplate Configurable Strategy [Yosiet],this is a boilerplate codehello first of all let me introduce myself a little bit i dont come from the world of finance but from the world of information and communication technologies ict where we specialize in data processing with the aim of automating it and eliminating all human factors and actors in the processes you could say that i am an algotraderthat said in my journey through trading in recent years i have understood that this world is often shown to be incomplete all those who want to learn about trading only end up learning a small part of what it really entails they only seek to learn how to read candlesticks therefore i want to share with the entire community a fraction of what i have really understood it to beas a computer scientist the most important thing is the data it is the raw material of our work and without data you simply cannot do anything entropy is simple data in data is transformed data outthe quality of the outgoing data will directly depend on the incoming data there is no greater mystery or magic in the process in trading it is no different because at the end of the day it is nothing more than data as we often say if garbage comes in garbage comes outmost people focus on the results only on the outgoing data because in the end we all want the same thing to make easy money very few pay attention to the input data much less to the processnow i am not here to delude you because there is no bigger lie than easy money but i am here to give you a boilerplate code that will help you create strategies where you only have to concentrate on the quality of the incoming datato the pointthe code is a strategy boilerplate that applies the technique that you decide to customize for the criteria for opening a position it already has the other factors involved in trading programmed and automated1 the entrythis section of the boilerplate is the one that each individual must customize according to their needs and knowledge the code is offered with two simple wellknown strategies to exemplify how the code can be reused for your own benefitsfor the purposes of this post on tradingview i am going to use the simplest of the known strategies in trading for entries sma crossingpine script sma cross settingsmafast tasmaclose lengthmaslow tasmaopen lengththe strategy properties for all cases published herefor stock tsla h1 from 01012025 to 02152025for crypto xmrusdt 30m from 01012025 to 02152025for forex eurusd 5m from 01012025 to 02152025but the goal of this post is not to sell you a dream else to show you that the same entry decision works very well for some and does not for others and with this boilerplate code you only have to think of entries not exits2 schedules days sessionsas you know there are an infinite number of markets that are susceptible to the sessions of each country and the news that they announce during those sessions so the code already offers parameters so that you can condition the days and hours of operation filter the best time parameters for a specific market and time frame3 data filteringthe data offered in trading are numerical series presented in vectors on a time axis where an endless number of mathematical equations can be applied to process them with matrix calculation and nonlinear regressions being the best in my humble opinion4 read fundamental macroeconomic events newsthe boilerplate has integration with the tradingview sdk to detect when news will occur and offers parameters so that you can enable an exclusion time margin to not operate anything during that time window5 direction and sensein my experience i have found the peculiarity that the same algorithm works very well for a market in a time frame but for the same market in another time frame it is only a waste of time and money so now you can easily decide if you only want to open long short or both side positions and know how effective your strategy really is6 reading the money the purpose of everythingthe most important section in trading and the reason why many clients usually hire me as a financial programmer is reading and controlling the money because in the end everyone wants to win and no one wants to lose now they can easily parameterize how the money should flow and this is the genius of this boilerplate because it is what will really decide if an algorithm indicator a bunch of math equations for entries will really leave you good money over time7 managing the risk the ego destroyermany trades little money most traders focus on making money and none of them know about statistics and the few who do know something about it only focus on the winrate well with this code you can unlock what really matters the true success criteria to be able to live off of trading profit factor sortino ratio sharpe ratio and most importantly will you really make money8 managing emotionsfinally the main reason why many lose money is because they are very bad at managing their emotions because with this they will no longer need to do so because the boilerplate has already programmed criteria to chase the price in a position cut losses and maximize profitsin short this is a boilerplate code that already has the data processing and data output ready you only have to worry about the data inputand so the trader learned the greatest edge was not in predicting the storm but in building a boat that could not sinkdisclaimerthis post is intended for programmers and quantitative traders who already have a certain

262,Stochastic-Dynamic Volatility Band Model,the stochasticdynamic volatility band model is a quantitative trading approach that leverages statistical principles to model market volatility and generate buy and sell signals the strategy is grounded in the concepts of volatility estimation and dynamic market regimes where the core idea is to capture price fluctuations through stochastic models and trade around volatility bandsvolatility estimation and band constructionthe volatility bands are constructed using a combination of historical price data and statistical measures primarily the standard deviation σ of price returns which quantifies the degree of variation in price movements over a specific period this methodology is based on the classical works of blackscholes 1973 which laid the foundation for using volatility as a core component in financial models volatility is a crucial determinant of asset pricing and risk and it plays a pivotal role in this strategys designentry and exit conditionsthe entry conditions are based on the prices relationship with the volatility bands a long entry is triggered when the price crosses above the lower volatility band indicating that the market may have been oversold or is experiencing a reversal to the upside conversely a short entry is triggered when the price crosses below the upper volatility band suggesting overbought conditions or a potential market downturnthese entry signals are consistent with the mean reversion theory which asserts that asset prices tend to revert to their longterm average after deviating from it according to poterba and summers 1988 mean reversion occurs due to overreaction to news or temporary disturbances leading to price correctionsthe exit condition is based on the number of bars that have elapsed since the entry signal specifically positions are closed after a predefined number of bars typically set to seven bars reflecting a shortterm trading horizon this exit mechanism is in line with shortterm momentum trading strategies discussed in literature where traders capitalize on price movements within specific timeframes jegadeesh titman 1993market adaptabilityone of the key features of this strategy is its dynamic nature as it adapts to the changing volatility environment the volatility bands automatically adjust to market conditions expanding in periods of high volatility and contracting when volatility decreases this dynamic adjustment helps the strategy remain robust across different market regimes as it is capable of identifying both trendfollowing and meanreverting opportunitiesthis dynamic adaptability is supported by the adaptive market hypothesis lo 2004 which posits that market participants evolve their strategies in response to changing market conditions akin to the adaptive nature of biological systemsreferencesblack f scholes m 1973 the pricing of options and corporate liabilities journal of political economy 813 637654 bollinger j 1980 bollinger on bollinger bands wiley jegadeesh n titman s 1993 returns to buying winners and selling losers implications for stock market efficiency journal of finance 481 6591 lo a w 2004 the adaptive markets hypothesis market efficiency from an evolutionary perspective journal of portfolio management 305 1529 poterba j m summers l h 1988 mean reversion in stock prices evidence and implications journal of financial economics 221 2759,"{'educational', 'Standard Deviation', 'Volatility'}",True,True,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

326,Forex Hammer and Hanging Man Strategy,the strategy is based on two key candlestick chart patterns hammer and hanging man these chart patterns are widely used in technical analysis to identify potential reversal points in the market their relevance in the forex market known for its high liquidity and volatile price movements is particularly pronounced both patterns provide insights into market sentiment and trader psychology which are critical in currency trading where shortterm volatility plays a significant role1 hammer typically occurs after a downtrend signals a potential trend reversal to the upside a hammer has a small body close and open are close to each other a long lower shadow at least twice as long as the body no or a very short upper shadow2 hanging man typically occurs after an uptrend signals a potential reversal to the downside a hanging man has a small body similar to the hammer a long lower shadow at least twice as long as the body a small or no upper shadowthese patterns are a manifestation of market psychology specifically the tugofwar between buyers and sellers the hammer reflects a situation where sellers tried to push the price down but were overpowered by buyers while the hanging man shows that buyers failed to maintain the upward movement and sellers could take controlrelevance of chart patterns in forexin the forex market chart patterns are vital tools because they offer insights into price action and market sentiment since forex trading often involves large volumes of trades chart patterns like the hammer and hanging man are important for recognizing potential shifts in market momentum these patterns are a part of technical analysis which aims to forecast future price movements based on historical data relying on the psychology of market participantsscientific literature on the relevance of candlestick patterns1 behavioral finance and candlestick patternsresearch on behavioral finance supports the idea that candlestick patterns such as the hammer and hanging man are relevant because they reflect shifts in trader psychology and sentiment according to lo mamaysky and wang 2000 patterns like these could be seen as representations of collective investor behavior influenced by overreaction optimism or pessimism and can often signal reversals in market trends 2 statistical validation of chart patternsstudies by brock lakonishok and lebaron 1992 explored the profitability of technical analysis strategies including candlestick patterns and found evidence that certain patterns such as the hammer can have predictive value in financial markets while their study primarily focused on stock markets their findings are generally applicable to the forex market as well 3 market efficiency and candlestick patternsthe efficient market hypothesis emh posits that all available information is reflected in asset prices but some studies suggest that markets may not always be perfectly efficient allowing for profitable exploitation of certain chart patterns for instance jegadeesh and titman 1993 found that momentum strategies which often rely on price patterns and trends could generate significant returns suggesting that patterns like the hammer or hanging man may provide a slight edge particularly in shortterm forex tradingtesting the strategy in forex using the provided scriptthe provided script allows traders to test and evaluate the hammer and hanging man patterns in forex trading by entering positions when these patterns appear and holding the position for a specified number of periods this strategy can be tested to assess its performance across different currency pairs and timeframes1 testing on different timeframes the effectiveness of candlestick patterns can vary across different timeframes as market dynamics change with the level of detail in each timeframe shorter timeframes may provide more frequent signals but with higher noise while longer timeframes may produce more reliable signals but with fewer opportunities this multitimeframe analysis could be an area to explore to enhance the strategys robustness 2 exit strategies the script incorporates an exit strategy where positions are closed after holding them for a specified number of periods this is useful for testing how long the reversal patterns typically take to play out and when the optimal exit occurs for maximum profitability it can also help to adjust the exit logic based on realtime market behaviorconclusionthe hammer and hanging man patterns are widely recognized in technical analysis as potential reversal signals and their application in forex trading is valuable due to the markets high volatility and liquidity this strategy leverages these candlestick patterns to enter and exit trades based on shifts in market sentiment and psychology testing and optimization as offered by the script can help refine the strategy and improve its effectivenessfor further refinement it could be valuable to consider combining candlestick patterns with other technical indicators or using multitimeframe analysis to confirm patterns and increase the probability of successful

concept is the bullish reversal bar candlestick pattern this is just the single bar pattern the rules are simplecandle shall be closed in its upper halfhigh of this candle shall be below all three alligators lines jaw lips teethnext lets discuss the shortterm trend filter which combines the williams alligator and williams fractals williams alligatordeveloped by bill williams the alligator is a technical indicator that identifies trends and potential market reversals it consists of three smoothed moving averagesjaw blue line the slowest of the three based on a 13period smoothed moving average shifted 8 bars aheadteeth red line the mediumspeed line derived from an 8period smoothed moving average shifted 5 bars forwardlips green line the fastest line calculated using a 5period smoothed moving average shifted 3 bars forwardwhen the lines diverge and align in order the alligator is awake signaling a strong trend when the lines overlap or intertwine the alligator is asleep indicating a rangebound or sideways market this indicator helps traders determine when to enter or avoid tradesfractals another tool by bill williams help identify potential reversal points on a price chart a fractal forms over at least five consecutive bars with the middle bar showing eitherup fractal occurs when the middle bar has a higher high than the two preceding and two following bars suggesting a potential downward reversaldown fractal happens when the middle bar shows a lower low than the surrounding two bars hinting at a possible upward reversaltraders often use fractals alongside other indicators to confirm trends or reversals enhancing decisionmaking accuracyhow do these tools work together in this strategy lets consider an example of an uptrendwhen the price breaks above an up fractal it signals a potential bullish trend this occurs because the up fractal represents a shift in market behavior where a temporary high was formed due to selling pressure if the price revisits this level and breaks through it suggests the market sentiment has turned bullishthe breakout must occur above the alligators teeth line to confirm the trend a breakout below the teeth is considered invalid and the downtrend might still persist conversely in a downtrend the same logic applies with down fractalshow we can use all these indicators in this strategy this strategy is a counter trend one candles high shall be below all alligators lines during this market stage the bullish reversal bar candlestick pattern shall be printed this bar during the downtrend is a high probability setup for the potential reversal to the upside bulls were able to close the price in the upper half of a candle the breaking of its high is a high probability signal that trend change is confirmed and script opens long trade if market continues going down and break down the bullish reversal bars low potential trend change has been invalidated and strategy close long tradeif market really reversed and started moving to the upside strategy waits for the trend change form the downtrend to the uptrend according to approximation of alligator and fractals combination if this change happens strategy close the trade this approach helps to stay in the long trade while the uptrend continuation is likely and close it if there is a high probability of the uptrend finishoptionally users can enable mfi and ao filters first of all lets briefly explain what are these two indicators the awesome oscillator ao created by bill williams is a momentumbased indicator that evaluates market momentum by comparing recent price activity to a broader historical context it assists traders in identifying potential trend reversals and gauging trend strengthao sma5median price sma34median pricewheremedian price high low 2sma5 5period simple moving average of the median pricesma 34 34period simple moving average of the median pricethis indicator is filtering signals in the following way if current ao bar is decreasing this candle can be interpreted as a bullish reversal bar this logic is applicable because initially this strategy is a trend reversal it is searching for the high probability setup against the current trend decreasing ao is the additional high probability filter of a downtrendlets briefly look what is mfi the market facilitation index mfi is a technical indicator that measures the price movement per unit of volume helping traders gauge the efficiency of price movement in relation to trading volume heres how you can calculate itmfi highlowvolumemfi can be used in combination with volume so we can divide 4 states bill williams introduced these to help traders interpret the interaction between volume and price movement heres a quick summarygreen window increased mfi increased volume indicates strong momentum with both price and volume increasing often a sign of trend continuation as both buying and selling interest are risingfake window increased mfi decreased volume shows that price is moving but with lower volume suggesting weak support for the trend this can signal a potential end of the current trendsquat window decreased mfi increased volume shows high volume but little price movement indicating a tugofwar between buyers and sellers this often precedes a breakout as the pressure buildsfade window decreased mfi decreased volume indicates a lack of interest from both buyers and sellers leading to lower momentum this typically happens in rangebound markets and may signal consolidation before a new movefor our purposes we are interested in squat bars this is the sign that volume cannot move the price easily this type of bar increases the probability of trend reversal in this indicator we added to enable the mfi filter of reversal bars if potential reversal bar or two preceding bars have squat state this bar can be interpret as a reversal onebacktest resultsoperating window date range of backtests is 20230101

328,Dynamic Support and Resistance Pivot Strategy ,the dynamic support and resistance pivot strategy is a flexible and adaptive tool designed to identify shortterm support and resistance levels using the concept of price pivots key elements of the strategy1 pivot points as support and resistance levelspivots are significant turning points on the price chart often marking local highs and lows where the price has reversed direction a pivot high occurs when the price forms a local peak while a pivot low occurs when the price forms a local trough when a new pivot high is formed it creates a resistance level conversely when a new pivot low is formed it creates a support level the strategy continuously updates these levels as new pivots are detected ensuring they remain relevant to the current market conditions by identifying these price levels the strategy dynamically adjusts to market conditions allowing it to adapt to both trending and ranging markets since it has a long target and can perform reversal operations2 entry criteria buy long a long position is triggered when the price is near the support level and then crosses it from below to above this suggests that the price has found support and may start moving upwards sell short a short position is triggered when the price is near the resistance level and then crosses it from above to below this indicates that the price may be reversing and moving downward3 supportresistance distance this parameter establishes a percentage range around the identified support and resistance level for example if the support resistance distance is 04 default the closing price must be within a range of 04 above support or below the resistance to be considered close and trigger a trade4 exit criteria take profit 27 stop loss 10 reversal if a new entry point is identified in the opposite direction5 no repainting the dynamic support and resistance pivot strategy is not subject to repainting6 position sizing by equity and risk management this strategy has a default configuration to operate with 35 of the equity the stop loss is set to 10 from the entry price this way the strategy is putting at risk about 10 of 35 of equity that is around 35 of equity for each trade the percentage of equity and stop loss can be adjusted by the user according to their risk management7 backtest results this strategy was subjected to backtest and operations in replay mode on 1000000mogusdtp with the inclusion of transaction fees at 012 and slipagge of 5 ticks and the past results have shown consistent profitability past results are no guarantee of future results the strategys backtest results may even be due to overfitting with past data8 chart visualization support and resistance levels are displayed as green support and red resistance lines pivot prices are displayed as green pivot low and red pivot high labels in this image above the supportresistance distance parameter was set to 089 default configurationchart timeframe 1hpivot lengh 2supportresistance distance 04 stop loss 10 take profit 27 this parameter can alternatively be set to 0810 alternative configurationchart timeframe 20 minpivot lengh 4supportresistance distance 01 stop loss 10 take profit 25 1000000mogusdtp,"{'reversal', 'pivot', 'pricelevels', 'support', 'pivotlevels', 'pivothigh', 'supportandresitance', 'Pivot points and levels', 'pivotlow', 'Support and Resistance'}",True,False,True,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,True,True
329,Adaptive Momentum Reversion Strategy,the adaptive momentum reversion strategy an empirical approach to market behaviorthe adaptive momentum reversion strategy seeks to capitalize on market price dynamics by combining concepts from momentum and mean reversion theories this hybrid approach leverages a rate of change roc indicator along with bollinger bands to identify overbought and oversold conditions triggering trades based on the crossing of specific thresholds the strategy aims to detect momentum shifts and exploit price reversions to their meantheoretical frameworkmomentum and mean reversion momentum trading assumes that assets with a recent history of strong performance will continue in that direction while mean reversion suggests that assets tend to return to their historical average over time fama french 1988 poterba summers 1988 this strategy incorporates elements of both looking for periods when momentum is either overextended and likely to revert or when the assets price is temporarily underpriced relative to its historical trendrate of change roc the roc is a straightforward momentum indicator that measures the percentage change in price over a specified period wilder 1978 the strategy calculates the roc over a 2period window making it responsive to shortterm price changes by using roc the strategy aims to detect price acceleration and decelerationbollinger bands bollinger bands are used to identify volatility and potential price extremes often signaling overbought or oversold conditions the bands consist of a moving average and two standard deviation bounds that adjust dynamically with price volatility bollinger 2002 the strategy employs two sets of bollinger bands one for shortterm volatility lower band and another for longerterm trends upper band with different lengths and standard deviation multipliersstrategy constructionindicator inputs roc period the rate of change is computed over a 2period window which provides sensitivity to shortterm price fluctuations bollinger bands lower band calculated with a 18period length and a standard deviation of 17 upper band calculated with a 21period length and a standard deviation of 21calculations roc calculation the roc is computed by comparing the current close price to the close price from rocperiod days ago expressing it as a percentage bollinger bands the strategy calculates both upper and lower bollinger bands around the roc using a simple moving average as the central basis the lower bollinger band is used as a reference for identifying potential long entry points when the roc crosses above it while the upper bollinger band serves as a reference for exits when the roc crosses below ittrading conditions long entry a long position is initiated when the roc crosses above the lower bollinger band signaling a potential shift from a period of low momentum to an increase in price movement exit condition a position is closed when the roc crosses under the upper bollinger band or when the roc drops below the lower band again indicating a reversal or weakening of momentumvisual indicators roc plot the roc is plotted as a line to visualize the momentum direction bollinger bands the upper and lower bands along with their basis simple moving averages are plotted to delineate the expected range for the rocbackground color to enhance decisionmaking the strategy colors the background when extreme conditions are detectedgreen for oversold roc below the lower band and red for overbought roc above the upper band indicating potential reversal zonesstrategy performance considerationsthe use of bollinger bands in this strategy provides an adaptive framework that adjusts to changing market volatility when volatility increases the bands widen allowing for larger price movements while during quieter periods the bands contract reducing trade signals this adaptiveness is critical in maintaining strategy effectiveness across different market conditionsthe strategys pyramiding setting is disabled pyramiding0 ensuring that only one position is taken at a time which is a conservative risk management approach additionally the strategy includes transaction costs and slippage parameters to account for realworld trading conditionsempirical evidence and relevancethe combination of momentum and mean reversion has been widely studied and shown to provide profitable opportunities under certain market conditions studies such as jegadeesh and titman 1993 confirm that momentum strategies tend to work well in trending markets while mean reversion strategies have been effective during periods of high volatility or after sharp price movements de bondt thaler 1985 by integrating both strategies into one system the adaptive momentum reversion strategy may be able to capitalize on both trending and reverting market behaviorfurthermore research by chan 1996 on momentumbased trading systems demonstrates that adaptive strategies which adjust to changes in market volatility often outperform static strategies providing a compelling rationale for the use of bollinger bands in this contextconclusionthe adaptive momentum reversion strategy provides a robust framework for trading based on the dual concepts of momentum and mean reversion by using roc in combination with bollinger bands the strategy is capable of identifying overbought and oversold conditions while adapting to changing market conditions the use of adaptive indicators ensures that the strategy remains flexible and can perform across different market

352,Kernel Regression Envelope with SMI Oscillator,this script combines the predictive capabilities of the nadarayawatson estimator implemented by the esteemed jdehorty credit to him for his excellent work on the kernelfunctions library and the original nadarayawatson envelope indicator with the confirmation strength of the stochastic momentum index smi to create a dynamic trend reversal strategy the core idea is to identify potential overbought and oversold conditions using the nadarayawatson envelope and then confirm these signals with the smi before entering a tradeunderstanding the nadarayawatson envelopethe nadarayawatson estimator is a nonparametric regression technique that essentially calculates a weighted average of past price data to estimate the current underlying trend unlike simple moving averages that give equal weight to all past data within a defined period the nadarayawatson estimator uses a kernel function in this case the rational quadratic kernel to assign weights the key parameters influencing this estimation are lookback window h this determines how many historical bars are considered for the estimation a larger window results in a smoother estimation while a smaller window makes it more reactive to recent price changes relative weighting alpha this parameter controls the influence of different time frames in the estimation lower values emphasize longerterm price action while higher values make the estimator more sensitive to shorterterm movements start regression at bar x_0 this allows you to exclude the potentially volatile initial bars of a chart from the calculation leading to a more stable estimationthe script calculates the nadarayawatson estimation for the closing price yhat_close as well as the highs yhat_high and lows yhat_low the yhat_close is then used as the central trend linedynamic envelope bands with atrto identify potential entry and exit points around the nadarayawatson estimation the script uses average true range atr to create dynamic envelope bands atr measures the volatility of the price by multiplying the atr by different factors nearfactor and farfactor we create multiple bands near bands these are closer to the nadarayawatson estimation and are intended to identify potential immediate overbought or oversold zones far bands these are further away and can act as potential takeprofit or stoploss levels representing more extreme price extensionsthe script calculates both near and far upper and lower bands as well as an average between the near and far bands this provides a nuanced view of potential support and resistance levels around the estimated trendconfirming reversals with the stochastic momentum index smiwhile the nadarayawatson envelope identifies potential overextended conditions the stochastic momentum index smi is used to confirm a potential trend reversal the smi unlike a traditional stochastic oscillator oscillates around a zero line it measures the location of the current closing price relative to the median of the highlow range over a specified periodthe script calculates the smi on a higher timeframe defined by the timeframe input to gain a broader perspective on the market momentum this helps to filter out potential whipsaws and false signals that might occur on the current charts timeframe the smi calculation involves k length the lookback period for calculating the highest high and lowest low d length the period for smoothing the relative range ema length the period for smoothing the smi itselfthe script uses a double ema for smoothing within the smi calculation for added smoothnesshow the indicators work together in the strategythe strategy enters a long position when1 the closing price crosses below the near lower band of the nadarayawatson envelope suggesting a potential oversold condition2 the smi crosses above its ema indicating positive momentum3 the smi value is below 50 further supporting the oversold idea on the higher timeframeconversely the strategy enters a short position when1 the closing price crosses above the near upper band of the nadarayawatson envelope suggesting a potential overbought condition2 the smi crosses below its ema indicating negative momentum3 the smi value is above 50 further supporting the overbought idea on the higher timeframetrades are closed when the price crosses the far band in the opposite direction of the trade a stoploss is also implemented based on a fixed valuein essence the nadarayawatson envelope identifies areas where the price might be deviating significantly from its estimated trend the smi calculated on a higher timeframe then acts as a confirmation signal suggesting that the momentum is shifting in the direction of a potential reversal the atrbased bands provide dynamic entry and exit points based on the current volatilityhow to use the script1 apply the script to your chart2 adjust the kernel settings lookback window h experiment with different values to find the smoothness that best suits the asset and timeframe you are trading lower values make the envelope more reactive while higher values make it smoother relative weighting alpha adjust to control the influence of different timeframes on the nadarayawatson estimation start regression at bar x_0 increase this value if you want to exclude the initial potentially volatile bars from the calculation stoploss set your desired stoploss value3 adjust the smi settings k length d length ema length these parameters control the sensitivity and smoothness of the smi experiment to find settings that work well for your trading style timeframe select the higher timeframe you want to use for smi confirmation4 adjust the atr length and nearfar atr factor these settings control the width and sensitivity of the envelope bands smaller atr lengths make the bands more reactive to recent volatility5 customize the color settings to your preference6 observe the plots the nadarayawatson estimation yhat line represents the estimated underlying trend the near and far upper and lower bands visualize potential overbought and oversold zones based on the atr the fill areas highlight the regions between the near and far bands7 look for entry signals a long entry is considered when the price touches or crosses below the lower near band and the smi confirms upward momentum a short entry is considered when the price touches or crosses above the upper near band and the smi confirms downward momentum8 manage your trades the script provides exit signals when the price crosses the far band the fixed stoploss will also close trades if the price moves against your positionjustification for combining nadarayawatson envelope and smithe combination of the nadarayawatson envelope and the smi provides a more robust approach to identifying potential trend reversals compared to using either indicator in isolation the nadarayawatson envelope excels at identifying potential areas where the price is overextended relative to its recent history however relying solely on the envelope can lead to false signals especially in choppy or volatile markets by incorporating the smi as a confirmation tool we add a momentum filter that helps to validate the potential reversals signaled by the envelope the higher timeframe smi further helps to filter out noise and focus on more significant shifts in momentum the atrbased bands add a dynamic element to the entry and exit points adapting to the current market volatility this mashup aims to leverage the strengths of each indicator to create a more

the three supertrend lines combined with the ema to generate trade signalsentry conditionsa long entry is triggered when all three supertrend lines are in an uptrend ie all three supertrend lines are below the price and the price is above the ema this suggests a strong bullish market conditiona short entry is triggered when all three supertrend lines are in a downtrend ie all three supertrend lines are above the price and the price is below the ema this suggests a strong bearish market conditionexit conditionsa long exit occurs when the third supertrend the least sensitive one switches to a downtrend ie the price falls below ita short exit occurs when the third supertrend switches to an uptrend ie the price rises above it5 visualizationthe strategy also plots the following on the chartthe ema is plotted as a blue line which helps identify the overall trendthe three supertrend lines are plotted with different colorssupertrend 1 green for uptrend and red for downtrendsupertrend

372,3 EMA + RSI with Trail Stop [Free990] (LOW TF),this trading strategy combines three exponential moving averages emas to identify trend direction uses rsi to signal exit conditions and applies both a fixed percentage stoploss and a trailing stop for risk management it aims to capture momentum when the faster emas cross the slower ema then uses rsi thresholds timebased exits and stops to close tradesshort explanation of the logictrend detection when the 10 ema crosses above the 20 ema and both are above the 100 ema and the current price bar closes higher it triggers a long entry signal the reverse happens for a short the 10 ema crosses below the 20 ema and both are below the 100 emarsi exit rsi crossing above a set threshold closes long trades crossing below another threshold closes

before opening a new shortexit signalsrsibased exitsfor long trades when rsi exceeds a specified threshold eg 70 by default it triggers a long exit rsi short_rsi generally means overbought conditions so the strategy exits to lock in profits or avoid a pullbackfor short trades when rsi dips below a specified threshold eg 30 by default it triggers a short exit rsi long_rsi indicates oversold conditions so the strategy closes the short to avoid a bouncetimebased exitif the trade has been open for xbars bars configurable eg 24 bars and the trade is in profit current price above entry for a long or current price below entry for a short the strategy closes the position this helps lock in gains if the move takes too long or momentum stallsstoploss managementfixed stoploss based each trade has a fixed stoploss calculated as a percentage from the average entry pricefor long positions the stoploss is set below the entry price by a userdefined percentage fixstoplosspercfor short positions the stoploss is set above the entry price by the same percentagethis mechanism prevents catastrophic losses if the market moves strongly against the positiontrailing stopthe strategy also sets a trail

profits to run while still capping potential drawdowns if the price reversesorder execution flowwhen the conditions for a new position long or short are triggered the strategy first checks if theres an opposite position open if there is it closes that position before opening the new one prevents going both long and short simultaneouslyrsibased and timebased exits are checked on each bar if triggered the position is closedif the position remains open the fixed stoploss and trailing stop remain in effect until the position is exitedwhy this combination worksmultiple ema cross combining 10 20 and 100 emas balances shortterm momentum detection with a longerterm trend filter this reduces false signals that can occur if you only look at a single crossover without considering the broader trendrsi exits rsi provides a momentum oscillator viewhelpful for detecting overboughtoversold conditions acting as an extra confirmation to exittimebased exit prevents lingering trades if the position is in profit but failing to advance further it takes profit rather than risking a trend reversalfixed trailing stoploss the fixed stoploss is your safety net to cap worstcase losses the trailing stop allows the strategy to lock in gains by following the trade as it moves favorably thus maximizing profit potential while keeping risk in checkoverall this approach tries to capture

space between teeth and price became less transparentstrategy settingsin the inputs window user can setup strategy setting ema length by default 100 period of ema used for longterm trend filtering ema calculation user can choose the optimal parameters during backtesting on certain price chartjustification of methodologylets explore the key concepts of this strategy and understand how they work together well begin with the simplest the emathe exponential moving average ema is a type of moving average that assigns greater weight to recent price data making it more responsive to current market changes compared to the simple moving average sma this tool is widely used in technical analysis to identify trends and generate buy or sell signals the ema is calculated as follows1calculate the smoothing multipliermultiplier 2 n 1 where n is the number of periods2 ema calculationema current price multiplier previous ema 1 multiplierin this strategy the ema acts as a longterm trend filter for instance long trades are considered only when the price closes above the ema default 100period this increases the likelihood of entering trades aligned with the prevailing trendnext lets discuss the shortterm trend filter which combines the williams alligator and williams fractals williams alligatordeveloped by bill williams the alligator is a technical indicator that identifies trends and potential market reversals it consists of three smoothed moving averagesjaw blue line the slowest of the three based on a 13period smoothed moving average shifted 8 bars aheadteeth red line the mediumspeed line derived from an 8period smoothed moving average shifted 5 bars forwardlips green line the fastest line calculated using a 5period smoothed moving average shifted 3 bars forwardwhen the lines diverge and align in order the alligator is awake signaling a strong trend when the lines overlap or intertwine the alligator is asleep indicating a rangebound or sideways market this indicator helps traders determine when to enter or avoid tradesfractals another tool by bill williams help identify potential reversal points on a price chart a fractal forms over at least five consecutive bars with the middle bar showing eitherup fractal occurs when the middle bar has a higher high than the two preceding and two following bars suggesting a potential downward reversaldown fractal happens when the middle bar shows a lower low than the surrounding two bars hinting at a possible upward reversaltraders often use fractals alongside other indicators to confirm trends or reversals enhancing decisionmaking accuracyhow do these tools work together in this strategy lets consider an example of an uptrendwhen the price breaks above an up fractal it signals a potential bullish trend this occurs because the up fractal represents a shift in market behavior where a temporary high was formed due to selling pressure if the price revisits this level and breaks through it suggests the market sentiment has turned bullishthe breakout must occur above the alligators teeth line to confirm the trend a breakout below the teeth is considered invalid and the downtrend might still persist conversely in a downtrend the same logic applies with down fractalsin this strategy if the most recent up fractal breakout occurs above the alligators teeth and follows the last down fractal breakout below the teeth the algorithm identifies an uptrend long trades can be opened during this phase if a signal aligns if the price breaks a down fractal below the teeth line during an uptrend the strategy assumes the uptrend has ended and closes all open long tradesby combining the ema as a longterm trend filter with the alligator and fractals as shortterm filters this approach increases the likelihood of opening profitable trades while staying aligned with market dynamicsnow lets talk about accelerationdeceleration signals ac indicator is calculated using the awesome oscillator so lets first of all briefly explain what is awesome oscillator and how it can be calculated the awesome oscillator ao developed by bill williams is a momentum indicator designed to measure market momentum by contrasting recent price movements with a longerterm historical perspective it helps traders detect potential trend reversals and assess the strength of ongoing trendsthe formula for ao is as followsao sma5median price sma34median pricewheremedian price high low 2sma5 5period simple moving average of the median pricesma 34 34period simple moving average of the median pricethe accelerationdeceleration ac indicator introduced by bill williams measures the rate of change in market momentum it highlights shifts in the driving force of price movements and helps traders spot early signs of trend changes the ac indicator is particularly useful for identifying whether the current momentum is accelerating or decelerating which can indicate potential reversals or continuations for ac calculation we shall use the ao calculated above is the following formulaac ao sma5ao where sma5aois the 5period simple moving average of the awesome oscillatorwhen the ac is above the zero line and rising it suggests accelerating upward momentumwhen the ac is below the zero line and falling it indicates accelerating downward momentumwhen the ac is below zero line and rising it suggests the decelerating the downtrend momentum when ac is above the zero line and falling it suggests the decelerating the uptrend momentum now we can explain which ac signal types are used in this strategy the first type of long signal is when ac value is below zero line in this cases we need to see three rising bars on the histogram in a row after the falling one the second type of signals occurs above the zero line there we need only two rising ac bars in a row after the falling one to create the signal the signal bar is the last green bar in this sequence the strategy places the buy stop order one tick above the candles high which corresponds to the signal bar on ac indicatorafter that we can have the following scenariosprice hit the order on the next candle in this case strategy opened long with this priceprice doesnt hit the order price the next candle set lower high if current ac bar is increasing buy stop order changes by the script to the high of this new bar plus one tick this procedure repeats until price finally hit buy order or current ac bar become decreasing in the second case buy order cancelled and strategy wait for the next ac signalif long trades are initiated the strategy continues utilizing subsequent signals until the total number of trades reaches a maximum of 5 all open trades are closed when the trend shifts to a downtrend as determined by the combination of the alligator and fractals described earlierwhy we use ac signals if currently strategy algorithm considers the high probability of the shortterm uptrend with the alligator and fractals combination pointed out above and the longterm trend is also suggested by the ema filter as bullish rising ac bars after period of falling ac bars indicates the high probability of local pull back end and there is a high chance to open long trade in the direction of the most likely main uptrend the numbers of rising bars are different for the different ac values below or above zero line this is needed because if ac below zero line the local downtrend is likely to be stronger and needs more rising bars to confirm that it has been changed than if ac is above zerowhy strategy use only 10 per signal sometimes we can see the false signals which appears on sideways not risking that much script use only 10 per signal if the first long trade has been open and price continue going up and our trend approximation by alligator and fractals is uptrend strategy add another one 10 of capital to every next ac signal while number of active trades no more than 5 this capital allocation allows to take part in long trades when current uptrend is likely to be strong and use only 10 of capital when there is a high probability of sidewaysbacktest resultsoperating

teeth and price became less transparent strategy settingsin the inputs window user can setup strategy setting ema length by default 100 period of ema used for longterm trend filtering ema calculation user can choose the optimal parameters during backtesting on certain price chartjustification of methodologylets go through all concepts used in this strategy to understand how they works together lets start from the easies one the ema lets briefly explain what is ema the exponential moving average ema is a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices making it more responsive to current price changes compared to the simple moving average sma it is commonly used in technical analysis to identify trends and generate buy or sell signals it can be calculated with the following steps1calculate the smoothing multipliermultiplier 2 n 1 where n is the number of periods 2 ema calculationema current price multiplier previous ema 1 multiplierin this strategy uses ema an initial long term trend filter it allows to open long trades only if price close above ema by default 50 period it increases the probability of taking long trades only in the direction of the trendlets go to the next shortterm trend filter which consists of alligator and fractals lets briefly explain what do these indicators means the williams alligator developed by bill williams is a technical indicator designed to spot trends and potential market reversals it uses three smoothed moving averages referred to as the jaw teeth and lipsjaw blue line the slowest of the three based on a 13period smoothed moving average shifted 8 bars aheadteeth red line the mediumspeed line derived from an 8period smoothed moving average shifted 5 bars forwardlips green line the fastest line calculated using a 5period smoothed moving average shifted 3 bars forwardwhen these lines diverge and are properly aligned the alligator is considered awake signaling a strong trend conversely when the lines overlap or intertwine the alligator is asleep indicating a rangebound or sideways market this indicator assists traders in identifying when to act on or avoid tradesthe williams fractals another tool introduced by bill williams are used to pinpoint potential reversal points on a price chart a fractal forms when there are at least five consecutive bars with the middle bar displaying the highest high for an up fractal or the lowest low for a down fractal relative to the two bars on either sidekey pointsup fractal occurs when the middle bar has a higher high than the two preceding and two following bars suggesting a potential downward reversaldown fractal happens when the middle bar shows a lower low than the surrounding two bars hinting at a possible upward reversaltraders often combine fractals with other indicators to confirm trends or reversals improving the accuracy of trading decisionshow we use their combination in this strategy lets consider an uptrend example a breakout above an up fractal can be interpreted as a bullish signal indicating a high likelihood that an uptrend is beginning heres the reasoning an up fractal represents a potential shift in market behavior when the fractal forms it reflects a pullback caused by traders selling creating a temporary high however if the price manages to return to that fractals high and break through it it suggests the market has changed its mind and a bullish trend is likely emergingthe moment of the breakout marks the potential transition to an uptrend its crucial to note that this breakout must occur above the alligators teeth line if it happens below the breakout isnt valid and the downtrend may still persist the same logic applies inversely for down fractals in a downtrend scenario so if last up fractal breakout was higher than alligators teeth and it happened after last down fractal breakdown below teeth algorithm considered current trend as an uptrend during this uptrend long trades can be opened if signal was flashed if during the uptrend price breaks down the down fractal below teeth line strategy considered that uptrend is finished with the high probability and strategy closes all current long trades this combination is used as a short term trend filter increasing the probability of opening profitable long trades in addition to ema filter described abovenow lets talk about awesome oscillators sauser signals briefly explain what is the awesome oscillator the awesome oscillator ao created by bill williams is a momentumbased indicator that evaluates market momentum by comparing recent price activity to a broader historical context it assists traders in identifying potential trend reversals and gauging trend strengthao sma5median price sma34median pricewheremedian price high low 2sma5 5period simple moving average of the median pricesma 34 34period simple moving average of the median pricenow we know what is ao but what is the saucer signal this concept was introduced by bill williams lets briefly explain it and how its used by this strategy initially this type of signal is a combination of the following ao bars we need 3 bars in a row the first one shall be higher than the second the third bar also shall be higher than second all three bars shall be above the zero line of ao the price bar which corresponds to third saucers bar is our signal bar strategy places buy stop order one tick above the price bar which corresponds to signal barafter that we can have the following scenarios price hit the order on the next candle in this case strategy opened long with this priceprice doesnt hit the order price the next candle set lower low if current ao bar is increasing buy stop order changes by the script to the high of this new bar plus one tick this procedure repeats until price finally hit buy order or current ao bar become decreasing in the second case buy order cancelled and strategy wait for the next saucer signal if long trades has been opened strategy use all the next signals until number of trades doesnt exceed 5 all trades are closed when the trend changes to downtrend according to combination of alligator and fractals described above why we use saucer signals if ao above the zero line there is a high probability that price now is in uptrend if we take into account our two trend filters when we see the decreasing bars on ao and its above zero its likely can be considered as a pullback on the uptrend when we see the stop of ao decreasing and the first increasing bar has been printed there is a high probability that this local pull back is finished and strategy open long trade in the likely direction of a main trendwhy strategy use only 10 per signal sometimes we can see the false signals which appears on sideways not risking that much script use only 10 per signal if the first long trade has been open and price continue going up and our trend approximation by alligator and fractals is uptrend strategy add another one 10 of capital to every next saucer signal while number of active trades no more than 5 this capital allocation allows to take part in long trades when current uptrend is likely to be strong and use only 10 of capital when there is a high probability of sidewaysbacktest resultsoperating window date range of backtests is 20230101 20241125 it is chosen to let the strategy to close all opened

break the zero line to the upside to say that probability of short term trend change to the upside increased this zero line crossover shall be confirmed by the middle and slow periods cci indicators at the moment of breakout these two ccis shall be above 0 indicating that there is a high probability that price is in middle and long term uptrend this approach increases chances to have a long trade setup in the direction of midterm and longterm trends when the shortterm trend starts to reverse to the upsideadditionally strategy uses mfi to have a greater probability that fast cci breakout is confirmed by this indicator we consider the values of mfi above 50 as a higher probability that trend change from downtrend to the uptrend is real script opens long trades only if mfi is above 50 as you already know from the mfi description it incorporates volume in its calculation therefore we have another one confirmation factorfinally strategy uses ema an additional trend filter it allows to

403,Global Index Spread RSI Strategy,this strategy leverages the relative strength index rsi to monitor the price spread between a global benchmark index such as amex and the currently opened asset in the chart window by calculating the spread between these two the strategy uses rsi to identify oversold and overbought conditions to trigger buy and sell signalskey componentsglobal benchmark index the strategy compares the current asset with a predefined global index eg amex to measure relative performance the choice of a global benchmark allows the trader to analyze the current assets movement in the context of broader market trendsspread calculation the spread is calculated as the percentage difference between the current assets closing price and the global benchmark indexs closing price spreadcurrent asset closeglobal index closeglobal index close100 spreadglobal index closecurrent asset closeglobal index close100this metric provides a measure of how the current asset is performing relative to the global index a positive spread indicates the asset is outperforming the benchmark while a negative spread signals underperformancersi of the spread the rsi is then calculated on the spread values the rsi is a momentum oscillator that ranges from 0 to 100 and is commonly used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in asset prices an rsi below 30 is considered oversold indicating a potential buying opportunity while an rsi above 70 is overbought suggesting that the asset may be due for a pullbackstrategy logicentry condition the strategy enters a long position when the rsi of the spread falls below the oversold threshold default 30 this suggests that the asset may have been oversold relative to the global benchmark and might be due for a reversalexit condition the strategy exits the long position when the rsi of the spread rises above the overbought threshold default 70 indicating that the asset may have become overbought and a price correction is likelyvisual reference the rsi of the spread is plotted on the chart for visual reference making it easier for traders to monitor the relative strength of the asset in relation to the global benchmark overbought and oversold levels are also drawn as horizontal reference lines 70 and 30 along with a neutral level at 50 to show market equilibriumtheoretical basisthe strategy is built on the mean reversion principle which suggests that asset prices tend to revert to a longterm average over time when prices move too far from this meaneither being overbought or oversoldthey are likely to correct back toward equilibrium by using rsi to identify these extremes the strategy aims to profit from price reversalsmean reversion according to financial theory asset prices oscillate around a longterm average and any extreme deviation overbought or oversold conditions presents opportunities for price corrections poterba summers 1988momentum indicators rsi the rsi is widely used in technical analysis to measure the momentum of an asset its application to the spread between the asset and a global benchmark allows for a more nuanced view of relative performance and potential turning points in the assets price trajectorypractical applicationthis strategy works best in markets where relative strength is a key factor in decisionmaking such as in equity indices commodities or forex markets by assessing the performance of the asset relative to a global benchmark and utilizing rsi to identify extremes in price movements the strategy helps traders to make more informed decisions based on potential mean reversion pointswhile the global index spread rsi strategy offers a method for identifying potential price reversals based on relative strength and oversoldoverbought conditions it is important to recognize that no strategy is foolproof the strategy assumes that the historical relationship between the asset and the global benchmark will hold in the future but financial markets are subject to a wide array of unpredictable factors that can lead to sudden changes in price behaviorrisk of false signals the strategy relies heavily on the rsi to trigger buy and sell signals however like any momentumbased indicator rsi can generate false signals particularly in highly volatile or trending markets in such conditions the strategy may enter positions too early or exit too late leading to potential lossesmarket context the strategy may not account for macroeconomic events news or other market forces that could cause sudden shifts in asset prices external factors such as geopolitical developments monetary policy changes or financial crises can cause a divergence between the asset and the global benchmark leading to incorrect conclusions from the strategyoverfitting risk as with any strategy that uses historical data to make decisions there is a risk of overfitting the model to past performance this could result in a strategy that works well on historical data but performs poorly in live trading conditions due to changes in market dynamicsexecution risks the strategy does not account for slippage transaction costs or liquidity issues which can impact the execution of trades in realmarket conditions in fastmoving markets prices may move significantly between order placement and execution leading to worsethanexpected entry or exit pricesno guarantee of profit past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results the strategy should be used with caution and risk management techniques such as stop losses and position sizing should always be implemented to protect against significant lossestraders should thoroughly test and adapt the strategy in a simulated environment before applying it to live trades and consider seeking professional

426,Fibonacci ATR Fusion - Strategy [presentTrading],openscript again this time is also an atrrelated strategy enjoy if you have any questions let me know and ill help make this as effective as possible introduction and how it is differentthe fibonacci atr fusion strategy is an advanced trading approach that uniquely integrates fibonaccibased weighted averages with the average true range atr to identify and capitalize on significant market trends unlike traditional strategies that rely on single indicators or static parameters this method combines multiple timeframes and dynamic volatility measurements to enhance precision and adaptability additionally it features a 4step take profit tp mechanism allowing for systematic profittaking at various levels which optimizes both risk management and return potential in long and short market positionsbtcusd 6hr performance strategy how it works detailed explanationthe fibonacci atr fusion strategy utilizes a combination of technical indicators and weighted averages to determine optimal entry and exit points below is a breakdown of its key components and operational logic 1 enhanced true range calculationthe strategy begins by calculating the true range tr to measure market volatility accuratelypine scripttr maxhigh low abshigh previous close abslow previous close high and low highest and lowest prices of the current trading period previous close closing price of the preceding trading period max selects the largest value among the three calculations to account for gaps and limit movements 2 buying pressure bp calculationbuying pressure bp quantifies the extent to which buyers are driving the price upwards within a periodpine scriptbp close true low close current periods closing price true low the lower boundary determined in the true range calculation 3 ratio calculation for different periodsto assess the strength of buying pressure relative to volatility the strategy calculates a ratio over various fibonaccibased timeframespine scriptratio 100 sum of bp over n periods sum of tr over n periods n length of the period eg 8 13 21 34 55 sum of bp cumulative buying pressure over n periods sum of tr cumulative true range over n periodsthis ratio normalizes buying pressure making it comparable across different timeframes 4 weighted average calculationthe strategy employs a weighted average of

434,Payday Anomaly Strategy,the payday effect refers to a predictable anomaly in financial markets where stock returns exhibit significant fluctuations around specific pay periods typically these are associated with the beginning middle or end of the month when many investors receive wages and salaries this influx of funds often directed automatically into retirement accounts or investment portfolios such as 401k plans in the united states temporarily increases the demand for equities this phenomenon has been linked to a cycle where stock prices rise disproportionately on and around payday periods due to increased buyside liquidityacademic research on the payday effect suggests that this pattern is tied to systematic cash flows into financial markets primarily driven by employee retirement and savings plans the regularity of these cash infusions creates a calendarbased pattern that can be exploited in trading strategies studies show that returns on days around typical payroll dates tend to be above average and this pattern remains observable across various time periods and regionsthe rationale behind the payday effect is rooted in the behavioral tendencies of investors specifically the automatic reinvestment mechanisms used in retirement funds which align with monthly or semimonthly salary payments this regular injection of funds can cause market microstructure effects where stock prices temporarily increase only to stabilize or reverse after the funds have been invested consequently the payday effect provides traders with a potentially profitable opportunity by predicting these inflowsscientific bibliography on the payday effectma a pratt w r 2017 payday anomaly the market impact of semimonthly pay periods social science research network ssrn this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the payday effect exploring how returns tend to peak around payroll periods due to semimonthly cash flows the paper discusses how systematic inflows impact returns leading to predictable stock performance patterns on specific days of the monthlakonishok j smidt s 1988 are seasonal anomalies real a ninetyyear perspective the review of financial studies 14 403425 this foundational study explores calendar anomalies including the payday effect by examining data over nearly a century the authors establish a framework for understanding seasonal and monthly patterns in stock returns which provides historical support for the payday effectowen s rabinovitch r 1983 on the predictability of common stock returns a step beyond the random walk hypothesis journal of business finance accounting 103 379396 this paper investigates predictability in stock returns beyond random fluctuations it considers payday effects among various calendar anomalies arguing that certain dates yield predictable returns due to regular cash inflowsloughran t schultz p 2005 liquidity urban versus rural firms journal of financial economics 782 341374 while primarily focused on liquidity this study provides insight into how cash flows such as those from semimonthly paychecks influence liquidity levels and consequently impact stock prices around predictable pay datesariel r a 1990 high stock returns before holidays existence and evidence on possible causes the journal of finance 455 16111626 ariels work highlights stock return patterns tied to certain dates including paydays although the study focuses on preholiday returns it suggests broader implications of predictable investment timing reinforcing the calendarbased effects seen with payday anomaliessummaryresearch on the payday effect highlights a repeating pattern in stock market returns driven by scheduled payroll investments this cyclical increase in stock demand aligns with behavioral finance insights and market microstructure theories offering a valuable basis for trading strategies focused on the beginning middle and end of each month,"{'educational', 'statistics', 'Cycles'}",True,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False

446,Keltner Channel Strategy by Kevin Davey,keltner channel strategy descriptionthe keltner channel strategy is a volatilitybased trading approach that uses the keltner channel a technical indicator derived from the exponential moving average ema and average true range atr the strategy helps identify potential breakout or meanreversion opportunities in the market by plotting upper and lower bands around a central ema with the channel width determined by a multiplier of the atrcomponents1 exponential moving average emathe ema smooths price data by placing greater weight on recent prices allowing traders to track the markets underlying trend more effectively than a simple moving average sma in this strategy a 20period ema is used as the midline of the keltner channel2 average true range atrthe atr measures market volatility over a 14period lookback by calculating the average of the true ranges the greatest of the current high minus the current low the absolute value of the current high minus the previous close or the absolute value of the current low minus the previous close the atr captures how much an asset typically moves over a given period3 keltner channelthe upper and lower boundaries are set by adding or subtracting 15 times the atr from the ema these boundaries create a dynamic range that adjusts with market volatilitytrading logic long entry condition the strategy enters a long position when the closing price falls below the lower keltner channel indicating a potential buying opportunity at a support level short entry condition the strategy enters a short position when the closing price exceeds the upper keltner channel signaling a potential selling opportunity at a resistance levelthe strategy plots the upper and lower keltner channels and the ema on the chart providing a visual representation of support and resistance levels based on market volatilityscientific support for volatilitybased strategiesthe use of volatilitybased indicators like the keltner channel is supported by numerous studies on price momentum and volatility trading research has shown that breakout strategies particularly those leveraging volatility bands such as the keltner channel or bollinger bands can be effective in capturing trends and reversals in both trending and meanreverting markets who is kevin daveykevin davey is a highly respected algorithmic trader author and educator known for his systematic approach to building and optimizing trading strategies with over 25 years of experience in the markets davey has earned a reputation as an expert in quantitative and rulebased trading he is particularly wellknown for winning several world cup trading championships where he consistently demonstrated high returns with low risk,"{'educational', 'statistics', 'Bands and Channels'}",False,True,True,True,False,True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True
447,Bollinger Bands Mean Reversion by Kevin Davey ,bollinger bands mean reversion strategy descriptionthe bollinger bands mean reversion strategy is a popular trading approach based on the concept of volatility and market overreaction the strategy leverages bollinger bands which consist of an upper and lower band plotted around a central moving average typically using standard deviations to measure volatility when the price moves beyond these bands it signals potential overbought or oversold conditions and the strategy seeks to exploit a reversion back to the mean the central bandstrategy components1 bollinger bandsthe bands are calculated using a 20period simple moving average sma and a multiple usually 20 of the standard deviation of the assets price over the same period the upper band represents the sma plus two standard deviations while the lower band is the sma minus two standard deviations the distance between the bands increases with higher volatility and decreases with lower volatility2 mean reversionmean reversion theory suggests that over time prices tend to move back toward their historical average in this strategy a buy signal is triggered when the price falls below the lower bollinger band indicating a potential oversold condition conversely the position is closed when the price rises back above the upper bollinger band signaling an overbought conditionentry and exit logicbuy condition the strategy enters a long position when the price closes below the lower bollinger band anticipating a mean reversion to the central band smasell condition the long position is exited when the price closes above the upper bollinger band implying that the market is likely overbought and a reversal could occurthis approach uses mean reversion principles aiming to capitalize on shortterm price extremes and volatility compression often seen in sideways or nontrending markets scientific studies have shown that mean reversion strategies particularly those based on volatility indicators like bollinger bands can be effective in capturing small but frequent price reversals scientific basis for bollinger bandsbollinger bands developed by john bollinger are widely regarded in both academic literature and practical trading as an essential tool for volatility analysis and mean reversion strategies research has shown that bollinger bands effectively identify relative price highs and lows and can be used to forecast price volatility and detect potential breakouts studies in financial markets such as those by fernándezrodríguez et al 2003 highlight the efficacy of bollinger bands in detecting overbought or oversold conditions in various assets who is kevin daveykevin davey is an awardwinning algorithmic trader and highly regarded expert in developing and optimizing systematic trading strategies with over 25 years of experience davey gained significant recognition after winning the prestigious world cup trading championships multiple times where he achieved tripledigit returns with minimal drawdown his success has made him a key figure in algorithmic trading education with a focus on disciplined and rulebased trading systems,"{'Portfolio management', 'sentiment', 'Bands and Channels'}",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False
448,Advanced Multi-Seasonality Strategy,the multiseasonality strategy is a trading system based on seasonal market patterns seasonality refers to recurring market trends driven by predictable calendarbased events these patterns emerge due to economic cycles corporate activities eg earnings reports and investor behavior around specific times of the year studies have shown that such effects can influence asset prices over defined periods leading to opportunities for traders who exploit these patterns hirshleifer 2001 bouman jacobsen 2002how the strategy worksthe strategy allows the user to define four distinct periods within a calendar year for each period the trader selectsentry date month and day the date to enter the trade holding period the number of trading days to remain in the trade after the entry trade direction whether to take a long or short position during that periodthe system is designed with flexibility enabling the user to activate or deactivate each of the four periods the idea is to take advantage of seasonal patterns such as buying during historically strong periods and selling during weaker ones a wellknown example is the sell in may and go away phenomenon which suggests that stock returns are higher from november to april and weaker from may to october bouman jacobsen 2002seasonality in financial marketsseasonal effects have been documented across different asset classes and marketsequities stock markets tend to exhibit higher returns during certain months such as the january effect where prices rise after yearend taxloss selling haugen lakonishok 1987 commodities agricultural commodities often follow seasonal planting and harvesting cycles which impact supply and demand patterns fama french 1987 forex currency pairs may show strength or weakness during specific quarters based on macroeconomic factors such as fiscal yearend flows or central bank policy decisionsscientific basisresearch shows that market anomalies like seasonality are linked to behavioral biases and institutional practices for example investors may respond to tax incentives at the end of the year and companies may engage in window dressing haugen lakonishok 1987 additionally macroeconomic factors such as monetary policy shifts and holiday trading volumes can also contribute to predictable seasonal trends bouman jacobsen 2002risks of seasonal tradingwhile the strategy seeks to exploit predictable patterns there are inherent risksmarket changes seasonal effects observed in the past may weaken or disappear as market conditions evolve increased algorithmic trading globalization and policy changes can reduce the reliability of historical patterns lo 2004 overfitting one of the risks in seasonal trading is overfitting the strategy to historical data a pattern that worked in the past may not necessarily work in the future especially if it was based on random chance or external factors that no longer apply sullivan timmermann white 1999 liquidity and volatility trading during specific periods may expose the trader to low liquidity especially around holidays or earnings seasons leading to slippage and largerthanexpected price swings economic and geopolitical shocks external events such as pandemics wars or political instability can disrupt seasonal patterns leading to unexpected market behaviorconclusionthe multiseasonality strategy capitalizes on the predictable nature of certain calendarbased patterns in financial markets by entering and exiting trades based on wellestablished seasonal effects traders can potentially capture shortterm profits however caution is necessary as market dynamics can change and seasonal patterns are not guaranteed to persist rigorous backtesting combined with risk management practices is essential to successfully implementing this strategyreferencesbouman s jacobsen b 2002 the halloween indicator sell in may and go away another puzzle american economic review 925 16181635 fama e f french k r 1987 commodity futures prices some evidence on forecast power premiums and the theory of storage journal of business 601 5573 haugen r a lakonishok j 1987 the incredible january effect the stock markets unsolved mystery dow jonesirwin hirshleifer d 2001 investor psychology and asset pricing journal of finance 564 15331597 lo a w 2004 the adaptive markets hypothesis market efficiency from an evolutionary perspective journal of portfolio management 305 1529 sullivan r timmermann a white h 1999 datasnooping technical trading rule performance and the bootstrap journal of finance 545 16471691this strategy harnesses the power of seasonality but requires careful consideration of the risks and potential changes in market behavior over time,"{'educational', 'statistics', 'Cycles'}",False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True
449,Statistical Arbitrage,the statistical arbitrage strategy also known as pairs trading is a quantitative trading method that capitalizes on price discrepancies between two correlated assets the strategy assumes that over time the prices of these two assets will revert to their historical relationship the core idea is to take advantage of mean reversion a principle suggesting that asset prices will revert to their longterm average after deviating significantlystrategy mechanics1 selection of correlated assets the strategy focuses on two historically correlated assets eg equity index futures like dow jones mini and sp 500 mini these assets tend to move in the same direction due to similar underlying fundamentals such as overall market conditions by tracking their relative prices the strategy seeks to exploit temporary mispricings 2 spread calculation the spread is the difference between the prices of the two assets this spread represents the relationship between the assets and serves as the basis for determining when to enter or exit trades 3 mean and standard deviation the historical average mean of the spread is calculated using a simple moving average sma over a chosen period the strategy also computes the standard deviation volatility of the spread which measures how far the spread has deviated from the mean over time this allows the strategy to define statistically significant price deviations 4 entry signal mean reversion a buy signal is triggered when the spread falls below the mean by a multiple eg two of the standard deviation this indicates that one asset is temporarily undervalued relative to the other and the strategy expects the spread to revert to its mean generating profits as the prices converge 5 exit signal the strategy exits the trade when the spread reverts to the mean at this point the mispricing has been corrected and the profit from the mean reversion is realizedacademic supportstatistical arbitrage has been widely studied in finance and economics gatev goetzmann and rouwenhorsts 2006 landmark study on pairs trading demonstrated that this strategy could generate excess returns in equity markets their research found that by focusing on historically correlated stocks traders could identify pricing anomalies and profit from their eventual correctionadditionally avellaneda and lee 2010 explored statistical arbitrage in different asset classes and found that exploiting deviations in price relationships can offer a robust marketneutral trading strategy in these studies the strategys success hinges on the stability of the relationship between the assets and the timely execution of trades when deviations occurrisks of statistical arbitrage1 correlation breakdown one of the primary risks is the breakdown of correlation between the two assets statistical arbitrage assumes that the historical relationship between the assets will hold in the future however market conditions company fundamentals or external shocks eg macroeconomic changes can cause these assets to deviate permanently leading to potential losses for instance if two equity indices historically move together but experience divergent economic conditions or policy changes their prices may no longer revert to the expected mean 2 execution risk this strategy relies on efficient execution and tight spreads in volatile or illiquid markets the actual price at which trades are executed may differ significantly from expected prices leading to slippage and reduced profits 3 market risk although statistical arbitrage is designed to be marketneutral ie not dependent on the overall market direction it is not entirely riskfree systematic market shocks such as financial crises or sudden shifts in market sentiment can affect both assets simultaneously causing the spread to widen rather than revert to the mean 4 model risk the assumptions underlying the strategy particularly regarding mean reversion may not always hold true the model assumes that asset prices will return to their historical averages within a certain timeframe but the timing and magnitude of mean reversion can be uncertain misestimating this timeframe can lead to extended drawdowns or unrealized losses 5 overfitting overreliance on historical data to finetune the strategy parameters eg the lookback period or standard deviation thresholds may result in overfitting this means that the strategy works well on past data but fails to perform in live markets due to changing conditionsconclusionthe statistical arbitrage strategy offers a systematic and quantitative approach to trading that capitalizes on temporary price inefficiencies between correlated assets it has been proven to generate returns in academic studies and is widely used by hedge funds and institutional traders for its marketneutral characteristics however traders must be aware of the inherent risks including correlation breakdown execution risks and the potential for prolonged deviations from the mean effective risk management diversification and constant monitoring are essential for successfully implementing this strategy in live

450,ICT Master Suite [Trading IQ],hello traderswere excited to introduce the ict master suite by tradingiq a new tool designed to bring together several ict concepts and strategies in one placethe purpose behind the ict master suitethere are a few challenges traders often face when using ictrelated indicatorsmany available indicators focus on one or two ict methods which can limit traders who apply a broader range of ict related techniques on their charts there arent many indicators for ict strategy models and we couldnt find ict indicators that allow for testing the strategy models and setting alerts many ict related concepts exist in the public domain as indicators not strategies this makes it difficult to verify that the ict concept has some utility in the market youre trading and if its worth trading its difficult to know if its workingsome users might not have enough chart space to apply numerous ict related indicators which can be restrictive for those wanting to use multiple ict techniques simultaneously the ict master suite is designed to offer a comprehensive option for traders who want to apply a variety of ict methods by combining several ict techniques and strategy models into one indicator it helps users maximize their chart space while accessing multiple tools in a single slot additionally the ict master suite was developed as a strategy this means users can backtest various ict strategy models including deep backtesting a primary goal of this indicator is to let traders decide for themselves what markets to trade ict concepts in and give them the capability to figure out if the strategy models are worth tradingwhat makes the ict master suite differentthere are many ictrelated indicators available on tradingview each offering valuable insights what the ict master suite aims to do is bring together a wider selection of these techniques into one tool this includes both key ict methods and strategy models allowing traders to test and activate strategies all within one indicatorfeaturesthe ict master suite offersmultiple ict strategy models including the 2022 strategy model and unicorn model which can be built tested and used for

453,Chande Momentum Oscillator Strategy,the chande momentum oscillator cmo trading strategy is based on the momentum oscillator developed by tushar chande in 1994 the cmo measures the momentum of a security by calculating the difference between the sum of recent gains and losses over a defined period the indicator offers a means to identify overbought and oversold conditions making it suitable for developing meanreversion trading strategies chande 1997strategy overviewcalculation of the chande momentum oscillator cmo the cmo formula considers both positive and negative price changes over a defined period commonly set to 9 days and computes the net momentum as a percentagethe formula is as follows cmo100sum of gainssum of lossessum of gainssum of losses cmo100sum of gainssum of lossessum of gainssum of losses this approach distinguishes the cmo from other oscillators like the rsi by using both price gains and losses in the numerator providing a more symmetrical measurement of momentum chande 1997entry condition the strategy opens a long position when the cmo value falls below 50 signaling an oversold condition where the price may revert to the mean research in meanreversion such as by poterba and summers 1988 supports this approach highlighting that prices often revert after sharp movements due to overreaction in the marketsexit conditions the strategy closes the long position when the cmo rises above 50 indicating that the price may have become overbought and may not provide further upside potential alternatively the position is closed 5 days after the buy signal is triggered regardless of the cmo value to ensure a timely exit even if the momentum signal does not reach the predefined level this exit strategy aligns with the concept of timebased exits reducing the risk of prolonged exposure to adverse price movements fama 1970scientific basis and rationalemomentum and meanreversion the strategy leverages the wellknown phenomenon of meanreversion in financial markets according to research by jegadeesh and titman 1993 prices tend to revert to their mean over short periods following strong movements creating opportunities for traders to profit from temporary deviations the cmo captures this meanreversion behavior by monitoring extreme price conditions when the cmo reaches oversold levels below 50 it signals potential buying opportunities whereas crossing overbought levels above 50 indicates conditions for sellingmarket efficiency and overreaction the strategy takes advantage of behavioral inefficiencies and overreactions which are often the drivers behind sharp price movements shiller 2003 by identifying these extreme conditions with the cmo the strategy aims to capitalize on the markets tendency to correct itself when price deviations become too largeoptimization and parameter selection the 9day period used for the cmo calculation is a widely accepted timeframe that balances responsiveness and noise reduction making it suitable for capturing shortterm price fluctuations studies in technical analysis suggest that oscillators optimized over such periods are effective in detecting reversals murphy 1999performance and backtestingthe strategys effectiveness is confirmed through backtesting which shows that using the cmo as a meanreversion tool yields profitable opportunities the use of timebased exits alongside momentumbased signals enhances the reliability of the strategy by ensuring that trades are closed even when the momentum signal alone does not materializeconclusionthe chande momentum oscillator trading strategy combines the principles of momentum measurement and meanreversion to identify and capitalize on shortterm price fluctuations by using a widely tested oscillator like the cmo and integrating a systematic exit approach the strategy effectively addresses both entry and exit conditions providing a robust method for trading in diverse market environmentsreferenceschande t s 1997 the new technical trader boost your profit by plugging into the latest indicators john wiley sons fama e f 1970 efficient capital markets a review of theory and empirical work the journal of finance 252 383417 jegadeesh n titman s 1993 returns to buying winners and selling losers implications for stock market efficiency the journal of finance 481 6591 murphy j j 1999 technical analysis of the financial markets a comprehensive guide to trading methods and applications new york institute of finance poterba j m summers l h 1988 mean reversion in stock prices evidence and implications journal of financial economics 221 2759 shiller r j 2003 from efficient markets theory to behavioral finance journal of economic perspectives 171 83104,"{'regressions', 'sentiment', 'Oscillators'}",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False
454,Ultimate Oscillator Trading Strategy,the ultimate oscillator trading strategy implemented in pine script is based on the ultimate oscillator uo a momentum indicator developed by larry williams in 1976 the uo is designed to measure price momentum over multiple timeframes providing a more comprehensive view of market conditions by considering shortterm mediumterm and longterm trends simultaneously this strategy applies the uo as a meanreversion tool seeking to capitalize on temporary deviations from the mean price level in the assets movement williams 1976strategy overviewcalculation of the ultimate oscillator uo the uo combines price action over three different periods shortterm mediumterm and longterm to generate a weighted momentum measure the default settings used in this strategy are shortterm 6 periods adjustable between 2 and 10 mediumterm 14 periods adjustable between 6 and 14 longterm 20 periods adjustable between 10 and 20 the uo is calculated as a weighted average of buying pressure and true range across these periods the weights are designed to give more emphasis to shortterm momentum reflecting the shortterm meanreversion behavior observed in financial markets murphy 1999entry conditions a long position is opened when the uo value falls below 30 indicating that the asset is potentially oversold the value of 30 is a common threshold that suggests the price may have deviated significantly from its mean and could be due for a reversal consistent with meanreversion theory jegadeesh titman 1993exit conditions the long position is closed when the current close price exceeds the previous days high this rule captures the reversal and price recovery providing a defined point to take profits the use of previous highs as exit points aligns with breakout and momentum strategies as it indicates sufficient strength for a price recovery fama 1970scientific basis and rationalemomentum and meanreversion the strategy leverages two wellestablished phenomena in financial markets momentum and meanreversion momentum identified in earlier studies like those by jegadeesh and titman 1993 describes the tendency of assets to continue in their direction of movement over short periods meanreversion as discussed by poterba and summers 1988 indicates that asset prices tend to revert to their mean over time after shortterm deviations this dual approach aims to buy assets when they are temporarily oversold and capitalize on their return to the meanmultitimeframe analysis the uos incorporation of multiple timeframes short medium and long provides a holistic view of momentum unlike singleperiod oscillators such as the rsi by combining data across different timeframes the uo offers a more robust signal and reduces the risk of false entries often associated with singleperiod momentum indicators murphy 1999trading and market efficiency studies in behavioral finance such as those by shiller 2003 show that shortterm inefficiencies and behavioral biases can lead to overreactions in the market resulting in price deviations this strategy seeks to exploit these temporary inefficiencies using the uo as a signal to identify potential entry points when the market sentiment may have overly pushed the price away from its averagestrategy performancebacktests of this strategy show promising results with profit factors exceeding 25 when the default settings are optimized these results are consistent with other studies on shortterm trading strategies that capitalize on meanreversion patterns jegadeesh titman 1993 the use of a dynamic multiperiod indicator like the uo enhances the strategys adaptability making it effective across different market conditions and timeframesconclusionthe ultimate oscillator trading strategy effectively combines momentum and meanreversion principles to trade on temporary market inefficiencies by utilizing multiple periods in its calculation the uo provides a more reliable and comprehensive measure of momentum reducing the likelihood of false signals and increasing the profitability of trades this aligns with modern financial research showing that

456,VIDYA ProTrend Multi-Tier Profit,hello this time is about a trendfollowing system vidya is quite an interesting indicator that adjusts dynamically to market volatility making it more responsive to price changes compared to traditional moving averages balancing adaptability and precision especially with the more aggressive short trade settings challenged me to finetune the strategy for a variety of market conditions introduction and how it is differentthe vidya protrend multitier profit strategy is a trendfollowing system that combines the vidya variable index dynamic average indicator with bollinger bands and a multistep takeprofit mechanism unlike traditional trend strategies this system allows for more adaptive profittaking adjusting for long and short positions through distinct atrbased and percentagebased targets the innovation lies in its dynamic multitier approach to profittaking especially for short trades where more aggressive percentages are applied using a multiplier this flexibility helps adapt to various market conditions by optimizing trade management and profit allocation based on market volatility and trend strengthbtcusd 6hr performance strategy how it works detailed explanationthe core of the vidya protrend multitier profit strategy lies in the dual vidya indicators fast and slow that analyze price trends while accounting for market volatility these

the bollinger bands and a unique wicktobody ratio approach to capture precise entry opportunities this indicator is designed for traders who want to pinpoint highprobability reversal points when price interacts with bollinger bands all while offering flexible entry fill optionsthe strategy performs primary analysis on the daily time frame regardless of your current chart setting allowing you to view daily bollinger band levels and entry signals even on lower time frames this approach is suitable for swing traders and shortterm traders looking to align intraday moves with higher time frame signalshow the strategy works1 bollinger band analysis on the daily time frame bollinger bands are calculated using a 20period simple moving average sma and a standard deviation multiplier default is 2 these bands dynamically expand and contract based on market volatility making them ideal for identifying overbought and oversold conditions upper band indicates potential overbought levels lower band indicates potential oversold levels2 wicktobody ratio condition this strategy places significant emphasis on candle wicks relative to the candle body heres why a large upper wick relative to the body signals potential selling pressure after testing the upper bollinger band a large lower wick relative to the body indicates buying support after testing the lower bollinger band ratio threshold you can set a minimum wicktobody ratio default is 10 meaning that the wick must be at least equal in size to the body this ensures only candles with significant reversals are considered for entry3 flexible entry timing to adapt to various trading styles the indicator allows you to choose the entry fill timing daily close enter at the close of the daily candle daily open enter at the open of the following daily candle hod high of day set entry at the daily high for those who want confirmation of upward momentum lod low of day set entry at the daily low ideal for confirming downward movement4

optimal times to enter and exit the market based on historical data and various indicators brings a dynamic edge to trading additionally it is integrated with the 3commas bot for automated trade executionim still working on it welcome to share your point of view introduction and how it is differentthe overnight positioning with ema is designed to capitalize on market inefficiencies during the overnight trading period this strategy takes a position shortly before the market closes and exits shortly after it opens the following day what sets this strategy apart is the integration of an optional exponential moving average ema filter which ensures that trades are aligned with the underlying trend the strategy provides flexibility by allowing users to select between different global market sessions such as the us asia and europe it is integrated with the 3commas bot for automated trade execution and has a builtin mechanism to avoid holding positions over the weekend by forceclosing positions on fridays before the market closesbtcusd 20 mins performance strategy how it works detailed explanationthe core logic of this strategy is simple enter trades before market close and exit them after market open taking advantage of potential price movements during the overnight period heres how it works in more detail market timingthe strategy determines the local market open and close times based on the selected market us asia europe and adjusts entry and exit points accordingly the entry is triggered a specific number of minutes before market close and the exit is triggered a specific number of minutes after market open ema filterthe strategy includes an optional ema filter to help ensure that trades are taken in the direction of the prevailing trend the ema is calculated over a userdefined timeframe and length the entry is only allowed if the closing price is above the ema for long positions which helps to filter out trades that might go against the

flexible enough to work across various global markets depending on the traders preference default settings1 entryminutesbeforeclose default 20 minutes this setting determines how many minutes before the market close the strategy will enter a long position a shorter duration could mean missing out on potential movements while a longer duration could expose the position to greater price fluctuations before the market closes2 exitminutesafteropen default 20 minutes this setting controls how many minutes after the market opens the position will be exited a shorter exit time minimizes exposure to market volatility at the open while a longer exit time could capture more of the overnight price movement3 emalength default 100 the length of the ema affects how the strategy filters trades a shorter ema eg 50 reacts more quickly to price changes allowing more frequent entries while a longer ema eg 200 smooths out price action and only allows entries when there is a stronger underlying trend the effect of using a longer ema eg 200 would be emat closet 2 200 1 emat1 1 2 200 1 4 ematimeframe default 240 this is the timeframe used for calculating the ema a higher timeframe

enables or disables the ema filter when enabled trades are only taken when the price is above the ema disabling the ema allows the strategy to enter trades without any trend validation which could increase the number of trades but also increase risk6 market selection default us this setting determines which global markets open and close times the strategy will use the selection of the market

474,ADX + Volume Strategy,strategy description adx and volumebased trading strategythis strategy is designed to identify strong market trends using the average directional index adx and confirm trading signals with volume the idea behind the strategy is to enter trades only when the market shows a strong trend as indicated by adx and when the price movement is supported by high trading volume this combination helps filter out weaker signals and provides more reliable entries into positions key indicators1 adx average directional index purpose adx is a technical indicator that measures the strength of a trend regardless of its direction up or down usage the strategy uses adx to determine whether the market is trending strongly if adx is above a certain threshold default is 25 it indicates that a strong trend is present directional indicators di directional indicator plus indicates the strength of the upward price movement di directional indicator minus indicates the strength of the downward price movement adx does not indicate the direction of the trend but confirms that a trend exists di and di are used to determine the direction2 volume purpose volume is a key indicator for confirming the strength of a price movement high volume suggests that a large number of market participants are supporting the movement making it more likely to continue usage the strategy compares the current volume to the 20period moving average of the volume the trade signal is confirmed if the current volume is greater than the average volume by a specified volume multiplier default multiplier is 15 this ensures that the trade is supported by strong market participation strategy logic entry conditions1 long position buy adx is above the threshold default is 25 indicating a strong trend di di signaling that the market is trending upward the current volume is greater than the 20period average volume multiplied by the volume multiplier eg 15 indicating that the upward price movement is backed by sufficient market activity2 short position sell adx is above the threshold default is 25 indicating a strong trend di di signaling that the market is trending downward the current volume is greater than the 20period average volume multiplied by the volume multiplier eg 15 indicating that the downward price movement is backed by strong selling activity exit conditions positions are closed when the opposite signal appears for long positions close when the short conditions are met adx still above the threshold di di and the volume condition holds for short positions close when the long conditions are met adx still above the threshold di di and the volume condition holds parameters adx period the period used to calculate adx default is 14 this controls how sensitive the adx is to price movements adx threshold the minimum adx value required for the strategy to consider the market trend as strong default is 25 higher values focus on stronger trends volume multiplier this parameter adjusts how much higher the current volume needs to be compared to the 20period moving average for the signal to be valid a value of 15 means the current volume must be 50 higher than the average volume example trade flow1 long trade example adx 25 confirming a strong trend di di confirming that the trend direction is upward the current volume is 50 higher than the 20period average volume multiplied by 15 action enter a long position2 short trade example adx 25 confirming a strong trend di di confirming that the trend direction is downward the current volume is 50 higher than the 20period average volume action enter a short position strengths of the strategy trend filtering the strategy ensures that trades are only taken when the market is trending strongly confirmed by adx and that the price movement is supported by high volume reducing the likelihood of false signals volume confirmation using volume as confirmation provides an additional layer of reliability as volume spikes often accompany sustained price moves dual signal confirmation both trend strength adx and volume conditions must be met for a trade making the strategy more robust weaknesses of the strategy limited effectiveness in rangebound markets since the strategy relies on strong trends it may underperform in sideways or nontrending markets where adx stays below the threshold lagging nature of adx adx is a lagging indicator which means that it may confirm the trend after it has already begun potentially leading to late entries volume requirement in lowvolume markets the volume multiplier condition may not be met often leading to fewer trade opportunities customization adjust the adx threshold you can raise the threshold if you want to focus only on very strong trends or lower it to capture moderate trends adjust the volume multiplier you can change the multiplier to be more or less strict a higher multiplier eg 20 will require a stronger volume spike to confirm the signal while a lower multiplier eg 12 will allow more trades with weaker volume confirmation summarythis adx and volume strategy is ideal for traders who want to follow strong trends while ensuring that the trend is supported by high trading volume by combining a trend strength filter adx and volume confirmation the strategy aims to increase the probability of entering profitable trades while reducing the number of false signals however it may underperform in rangebound markets or in markets with low volume,"{'ADX', 'Pine utilities', 'volumebased',

482,Bitcoin CME-Spot Z-Spread - Strategy [presentTrading],this time is a swing trading strategy it measures the sentiment of the bitcoin market through the spread of cme bitcoin futures and bitfinex btcusd spot prices by applying bollinger bands to the spread the strategy seeks to capture meanreversion opportunities when prices deviate significantly from their historical norms introduction and how it is differentthe bitcoin cmespot bollinger bands strategy is designed to capture meanreversion opportunities by exploiting the spread between cme bitcoin futures and bitfinex btcusd spot prices the strategy uses bollinger bands to detect when the spread between these two correlated assets has deviated significantly from its historical norm signaling potential overbought or oversold conditionswhat sets this strategy apart is its focus on spread trading between futures and spot markets rather than pricebased indicators by applying bollinger bands to the spread rather than individual prices the strategy identifies price inefficiencies across markets allowing traders to take advantage of the natural reversion to the mean that often occurs in these correlated assetsbtcusd 8hr performance strategy how it works detailed explanationthe strategy relies on bollinger bands to assess the volatility and relative deviation of the spread between cme bitcoin futures and bitfinex btcusd spot prices bollinger bands consist of a moving average and two standard deviation bands which help measure how much the spread deviates from its historical mean spread calculationthe spread is calculated by subtracting the bitfinex spot price from the cme bitcoin futures pricespread cme price bitfinex pricethis spread represents the difference between the futures and spot markets which may widen or narrow based on supply and demand dynamics in each market by analyzing the spread the strategy can detect when prices are too far apart potentially overbought or oversold indicating a trading opportunity bollinger bands calculationthe bollinger bands for the spread are calculated using a simple moving average sma and the standard deviation of the spread over a defined period1 moving average sma the simple moving average of the spread mu_s over a specified period p is calculated asmu_s 1p sums_i from i1 to p where s_i represents the spread at time i and p is the lookback period default is 200 bars the moving average provides a baseline for the normal spread behavior2 standard deviation the standard deviation sigma_s of the spread is calculated to measure the volatility of the spreadsigma_s sqrt1p sums_i mu_s2 from i1 to p3 upper and lower bollinger bands the upper and lower bollinger bands are derived by adding and subtracting a multiple of the standard deviation from the moving average the number of standard deviations is determined by a userdefined parameter k default is 2618 upper bandupper band mu_s k sigma_s lower bandlower band mu_s k sigma_sthese bands provide a dynamic range within which the spread typically fluctuates when the spread moves outside of these bands it is considered overbought or oversold potentially offering trading opportunitieslocal view entry conditions long entry a long position is triggered when the spread crosses below the lower bollinger band indicating that the spread has become oversold and is likely to revert upwardspread lower band short entry a short position is triggered when the spread crosses above the upper bollinger band indicating that the spread has become overbought and is likely to revert downwardspread upper band risk management and profittakingthe strategy incorporates multistep take profits to lock in gains as the trade moves in favor the position is gradually reduced at predefined profit levels reducing risk while allowing part of the trade to continue running if the price keeps moving favorablyadditionally the strategy uses a hold period exit mechanism if the trade does not hit any of the takeprofit levels within a certain number of bars the position is closed automatically to avoid excessive exposure to market risks trade directionthe trade direction is based on deviations of the spread from its historical norm long trade the strategy enters a long position when the spread crosses below the lower bollinger band signaling an oversold condition where the spread is expected to narrow short trade the strategy enters a short position when the spread crosses above the upper bollinger band signaling an overbought condition where the spread is expected to widenthese entries rely on the assumption of mean reversion where extreme deviations from the average spread are likely to revert over time usagethe bitcoin cmespot bollinger bands strategy is ideal for traders looking to capitalize on price inefficiencies between bitcoin futures and spot markets its especially useful in volatile markets where large deviations between futures and spot prices occur market conditions this strategy is most effective in correlated markets like cme futures and spot bitcoin traders can adjust the bollinger bands period and standard deviation multiplier to suit different volatility regimes backtesting before deployment backtesting the strategy across different market conditions and timeframes is recommended to ensure robustness adjust the takeprofit steps and hold periods to reflect the traders risk tolerance and market behavior default settingsthe default settings provide a balanced approach to spread trading using bollinger bands but can be adjusted depending on market conditions or personal trading preferences bollinger bands period 200 barsthis defines the number of bars used to calculate the moving average and standard deviation for the bollinger bands a longer period smooths out shortterm fluctuations and focuses on larger more significant trends adjusting the period affects the responsiveness of the strategy shorter periods eg 100 bars makes the strategy more reactive to shortterm market fluctuations potentially generating more signals but increasing the risk of false positives longer periods eg 300 bars focuses on longerterm trends reducing the frequency of trades and focusing only on significant deviations standard deviation multiplier 2618the multiplier controls how wide the bollinger bands are around the moving average by default the bands are set at 2618 standard deviations away from the average ensuring that only significant deviations trigger trades higher multipliers eg 30 require a more extreme deviation to trigger trades reducing trade frequency but potentially increasing the accuracy of signals lower multipliers eg 20 make the bands narrower increasing the number of trade signals but potentially decreasing their reliability takeprofit levelsthe strategy has four takeprofit levels to gradually lock in profits level 1 3 25 of the position is closed at a 3 profit level 2 8 20 of the position is closed at an 8 profit level 3 14 15 of the position is closed at a 14 profit level 4 21 10 of the position is closed at a 21 profitadjusting these takeprofit levels affects how quickly profits are realized lower takeprofit levels capture gains more quickly reducing risk but potentially cutting off larger profits higher takeprofit levels let trades run longer aiming for bigger gains but increasing the risk of price reversals before profits are locked in hold days 20 barsthe strategy automatically closes the position after 20 bars if none of the takeprofit levels are hit this feature prevents trades from being held indefinitely especially if market conditions are stagnant adjusting this shorter hold periods reduce the duration of exposure minimizing risks from market changes but

487,Multi-Step FlexiMA - Strategy [presentTrading],its time to come back hope i can not to be busy for a while introduction and how it is differentthe flexima variance tracker is a unique trading strategy that calculates a series of deviations between the price or another indicator source and a variablelength moving average ma unlike traditional strategies that use fixedlength moving averages the length of the ma in this system varies within a defined range the length changes dynamically based on a starting factor and an increment factor creating a more adaptive approach to market conditionsthis strategy integrates multistep take profit tp levels allowing for partial exits at predefined price increments it enables traders to secure profits at different stages of a trend making it ideal for volatile markets where taking full profits at once might lead to missed opportunities if the trend continuesbtcusd 6hr performance strategy how it works detailed explanation flexima conceptthe flexima flexible moving average is at the heart of this strategy unlike traditional mabased strategies where the ma length is fixed eg a 50period sma the flexima varies its length with each

entry and exit conditionsthe entry and exit signals are determined by the interaction between the supertrend polyfactor oscillator and the median value of the normalized deviations long entry the supertrend turns bearish and the median value of the deviations is positive short entry the supertrend turns bullish and the median value is negativesimilarly trades are exited when the supertrend flips direction the supertrend toolkit is made by elicobra trade directionthe strategy allows users to specify the desired trade direction long only long positions will be taken short only short positions will be taken both both long and short positions are allowed based on the conditionsthis flexibility allows the strategy to adapt to different market conditions and trading styles whether youre looking to buy low and sell high or sell high and buy low usagethis strategy can be applied across various asset classes including stocks cryptocurrencies and forex the primary use case is to take advantage of market volatility by using a flexible moving average and multiple takeprofit levels to capture profits incrementally as the market moves in your favorhow to use1 configure the inputs

497,Connors VIX Reversal III invented by Dave Landry,this strategy is based on trading signals derived from the behavior of the volatility index vix relative to its 10day moving average the rules are split into buying and selling conditionsbuy conditions the vix low must be above its 10day moving average the vix must close at least 10 above its 10day moving average if both conditions are met a buy signal is generated at the markets closesell conditions the vix high must be below its 10day moving average the vix must close at least 10 below its 10day moving average if both conditions are met a sell signal is generated at the markets closeexit conditionsfor long positions the strategy exits when the vix trades intraday below its previous days 10day moving average for short positions the strategy exits when the vix trades intraday above its previous days 10day moving averagethis strategy is primarily a meanreversion strategy where the market is expected to revert to a more normal state after the vix exhibits extreme behavior ie large deviations from its moving averageabout dave landrydave landry is a wellknown figure in the world of trading particularly in technical analysis

also provides trading education and tools for institutional and retail traders alike emphasizing strategies that can be backtested and quantifiedrisks of the strategywhile this strategy may appear to offer promising opportunities to exploit extreme vix movements it carries several risksmarket volatility the vix itself is a measure of market volatility meaning the strategy can be exposed to sudden and unpredictable market swings this can result in whipsaws where positions are opened and closed in rapid succession due to sharp reversals in the vix overfitting strategies based on specific conditions like the vix closing 10 above or below its moving average can be subject to overfitting meaning they work well in historical tests but may underperform in live markets this is a common issue in quantitative trading systems that are not adaptable to changing market conditions meanreversion assumption the core assumption behind this strategy is that markets will revert to their mean after extreme movements however during periods of sustained trends eg market crashes or rallies this assumption may break down leading to prolonged drawdownsliquidity and slippage depending on the asset being traded eg sp 500 futures etfs liquidity issues or slippage could occur when executing trades at market close particularly in volatile conditions this could increase costs or worsen trade executionscientific explanation of the strategythe vix is often referred to as the fear gauge because it measures the markets expectations of volatility based on options prices research has shown that the vix tends to spike during periods of market stress and revert to lower levels when conditions stabilize mean reversion strategies like this one assume that extreme vix levels are unsustainable in the long run which aligns with findings from academic literature on volatility and market behaviorstudies have found that the vix is inversely correlated with stock market returns meaning that higher vix levels often correspond to lower stock prices and vice versa by using the vixs relationship with its 10day moving average this strategy aims to capture reversals in market sentiment the 10 threshold is designed to identify moments when the vix is significantly deviating from its norm signaling a potential reversalhowever academic research also highlights the limitations of relying on the vix alone for trading signals the vix does not predict market direction only volatility meaning that it cannot indicate the magnitude of price movements furthermore extreme vix levels can persist longer than expected particularly during financial crisesin conclusion while the strategy is grounded in wellestablished financial principles eg mean reversion and the relationship between volatility and market performance it carries inherent risks and should be used with caution backtesting and careful risk management are essential before applying this strategy in live markets,"{'regressions',

504,Larry Connors %b Strategy (Bollinger Band),larry connors b strategy is a meanreversion trading approach that uses bollinger bands to identify buy and sell signals based on the b indicator this strategy was developed by larry connors a renowned trader and author known for his systematic datadriven trading methods particularly those focusing on shortterm mean reversionthe b indicator measures the position of the current price relative to the bollinger bands which are volatility bands placed above and below a moving average the strategy specifically targets times when prices are oversold within a longterm uptrend and aims to capture rebounds by buying at relatively low points and selling at relatively high pointsstrategy rulesthe basic rules of the b strategy are1 trend confirmation the closing price must be above the 200day moving average this filter ensures that trades are made in alignment with a longerterm uptrend thereby avoiding trades against the primary market trend 2 oversold conditions the b indicator must be below 02 for three consecutive days the b value below 02 indicates that the price is near the lower bollinger band suggesting an oversold condition 3 entry signal enter a long position at the close when conditions 1 and 2 are met 4 exit signal exit the position when the b value closes above 08 signaling an overbought condition where the price is near the upper bollinger bandhow the strategy worksthis strategy operates on the premise of mean reversion which suggests that extreme price movements will revert to the mean over time by entering positions when the b value indicates an oversold condition below 02 in a confirmed uptrend the strategy attempts to capture shortterm price rebounds the exit rule when b is above 08 aims to lock in profits once the price reaches an overbought condition often near the upper bollinger bandwho was larry connorslarry connors is a wellknown figure in the world of financial markets and trading he coauthored several influential trading books including shortterm trading strategies that work and high probability etf trading connors is recognized for his quantitative approach focusing on systematic

strategywhile the b strategy can be effective particularly in meanreverting markets it is not without risks1 mean reversion assumption the strategy is based on the assumption that prices will revert to the mean in trending or sharply falling markets this reversion may not occur leading to sustained losses 2 false signals in choppy markets in volatile or sideways markets the strategy may generate multiple false signals resulting in whipsaw trades that can erode capital through frequent small losses 3 no stop loss the basic implementation of the strategy does not include a stop loss which increases the risk of holding losing trades longer than intended especially if the market continues to move against the position 4 performance during market crashes during major market downturns the strategys buy signals could be triggered frequently as prices decline compounding losses without the presence of a risk management mechanismscientific references and theoretical basisthe b strategy relies on the concept of mean reversion which has been extensively studied in finance literature studies by avellaneda and lee 2010 and bouchaud et al 2018 have demonstrated that meanreverting strategies can be profitable in specific market environments particularly when combined with volatility filters like bollinger bands however the same studies caution that such strategies are highly sensitive to market conditions and often perform poorly during periods of prolonged trendsbollinger bands themselves were popularized by john bollinger and are widely used to assess price volatility and detect potential overbought and oversold conditions the b value is a critical part of this analysis as it standardizes the position of price relative to the bands making it easier to compare conditions across different securities and time framesconclusionlarry connors b strategy is a wellknown meanreversion technique that leverages bollinger bands to identify buying opportunities in uptrending markets when prices are temporarily oversold while the strategy can be effective under the right conditions traders should be aware of its limitations and risks particularly in trending or highly volatile markets incorporating risk management techniques such as stop losses could help mitigate some of these risks making the strategy more robust against adverse market

507,TRIN (Arms Index) Trading Strategy,the trin arms index also known as the shortterm trading index is a technical indicator designed to gauge the internal strength or weakness of the market it compares the number of advancing and declining stocks to the advancing and declining volume ad volume a trin value above 10 generally indicates bearish market conditions while a value below 10 suggests bullish market sentimentstrategy rulesentry condition long position when the trin value is above 10 the strategy enters a long position indicating that the market may be oversold and a potential reversal could occur exit condition the strategy exits the long position when the closing price is higher than the previous days high signaling a potential rebound in the marketthis strategy aims to capitalize on shortterm market inefficiencies by entering trades during periods of potential market weakness and exiting when signs of recovery appearhow the trin index worksthe trin is calculated as follows trinadvancing issues declining issuesadvancing volume declining volume trinadvancing volume declining volumeadvancing issues declining issues a trin value above 10 indicates that the market is potentially oversold more declining stocks with higher volume while a value below 10 suggests the market may be overbought more advancing stocks with higher volume empirical evidencemarket sentiment indicator the trin has been widely used as a sentiment indicator research by zweig 1997 suggests that extreme trin values can serve as a contrarian signal indicating potential turning points in the market for instance a trin above 20 is often considered a sign of panic selling which can precede a market bottom overboughtoversold conditions studies have shown that indicators like trin which measure market breadth and volume can be effective in identifying overbought and oversold conditions according to fama and french 1988 market sentiment indicators that consider both price and volume data can offer insights into future price movements risks and limitationsfalse signals one of the primary risks of using the trinbased strategy is the possibility of false signals a trin value above 10 does not always guarantee a market rebound especially in sustained bearish trends in such cases the strategy might enter long positions prematurely leading to losses research by brock lakonishok and lebaron 1992 found that while market indicators like trin can be useful they are not foolproof and can generate multiple false positives particularly in volatile markets market regimes the effectiveness of the trin index can vary depending on the market regime in strongly trending markets either bullish or bearish the trin may not provide reliable reversal signals and relying on it could result in trades that go against the prevailing trend for instance during strong bear markets the trin may frequently remain above 10 leading to multiple losing trades as the market continues to declineshortterm focus the trin strategy is inherently shortterm focused aiming to capture quick market reversals this makes it sensitive to market noise and less effective for longerterm investors moreover shortterm trading strategies often require more frequent adjustments and can incur higher transaction costs which may erode profitability over timeliquidity and execution risk since the trin strategy requires entering and exiting trades based on shortterm market movements it is vulnerable to liquidity and execution risks in fastmoving markets the execution of trades may be delayed leading to slippage and potentially unfavorable entry or exit pointsconclusionthe trin arms index trading strategy can be an effective tool for traders looking to capitalize on shortterm market inefficiencies and potential reversals however it is important to recognize the risks associated with this strategy including false signals sensitivity to market regimes and execution risks traders should employ proper risk management techniques and consider combining the trin with other indicators to improve the robustness of the strategywhile the trin provides valuable insights into market sentiment it is not a standalone solution and should be used in conjunction with a broader trading plan that takes into account both technical and fundamental analysisreferences arms richard w volume adjusted moving averages technical analysis of stocks commodities 1993 zweig martin winning on wall street warner books 1997 fama eugene f and kenneth r french permanent and temporary components of stock prices journal of political economy 1988 brock william josef lakonishok and blake lebaron simple technical trading rules and the stochastic properties of stock returns journal of finance 1992,"{'Volume', 'sentiment', 'Volatility'}",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False
508,Averaging Down Strategy,1 averaging downdefinition averaging down is a strategy in which an investor buys more shares of a declining asset thus lowering the average purchase price the main idea is that by averaging down the investor can recover faster when the price eventually rebounds risk considerations this strategy assumes that the asset will recover in value if the price continues to decline however the investor may suffer larger losses academic research highlights the psychological bias of loss aversion that often leads investors to engage in averaging down despite the increased risk barberis huang 20012 rsi relative strength indexdefinition the rsi is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements it ranges from 0 to 100 and is commonly used to identify overbought or oversold conditions a reading below 30 or in this case 35 typically indicates an oversold condition which might suggest a potential buying opportunity wilder 1978 risk considerations rsibased strategies can produce many false signals in rangebound or choppy markets where prices do not exhibit strong trends this can lead to multiple losing trades and an overall negative performance gencay 19983 combination of rsi and price movementapproach the combination of rsi for entry signals and price movement previous days high for exit signals aims to capture shortterm market reversals this hybrid approach attempts to balance momentum with price confirmation risk considerations while this combination can work well in trending markets it may struggle in volatile or sideways markets additionally a significant risk of averaging down is that the trader may continue adding to a losing position which can exacerbate losses if the price keeps fallingrisk warningsincreased losses through averaging down averaging down involves buying more of a falling asset which can increase exposure to downside risk studies have shown that this approach can lead to larger losses when markets continue to decline especially during prolonged bear markets statman 2004 a key risk is that this strategy may lead to significant capital drawdowns if the price of the asset does not recover as expected in the worstcase scenario this can result in a total loss of the invested capitalfalse signals with rsi rsibased strategies are prone to generating false signals particularly in markets that do not exhibit strong trends for example gencay 1998 found that while rsi can be effective in certain conditions it often fails in choppy or rangebound markets leading to frequent stopouts and drawdownspsychological bias behavioral finance research suggests that the averaging down strategy may be influenced by loss aversion a bias where investors prefer to avoid losses rather than achieve gains kahneman tversky 1979 this can lead to poor decisionmaking as investors continue to add to losing positions in the hope of a recoveryempirical studiesgencay 1998 the study the predictability of security returns with simple technical trading rules found that technical indicators like rsi can provide predictive value in certain markets particularly in volatile environments however they are less reliable in markets that lack clear trends barberis huang 2001 their research on behavioral biases including loss aversion explains why investors are often tempted to average down despite the risks as they attempt to avoid realizing losses statman 2004 in the diversification puzzle statman discusses how strategies like averaging down can increase risk exposure without necessarily improving longterm returns especially if the underlying asset continues to perform poorlyconclusionthe averaging down strategy with rsi combines elements of technical analysis with a psychologicallydriven averaging down approach while the strategy may offer opportunities in trending or oversold markets it carries significant risks particularly in volatile or declining markets traders should be cautious when using this strategy ensuring they manage risk effectively and avoid overexposure to a losing position,{'Oscillators'},False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
510,Fractal Proximity MA Aligment Scalping Strategy,fractal analysisfractals in trading help identify potential reversal points by marking significant price changes our strategy calculates a fractal value by comparing the current price to recent high and low fractal points this is done by evaluating the sum of distances from the current closing price to the recent highs and lows a positive fractal value suggests proximity to recent lows hinting at upward momentum conversely a negative value indicates closeness to recent highs signaling potential downward movementmoving averages for confirmationwe use a series of 20 moving averages ranging from 5 to 100 to confirm trend directions indicated by fractal analysis an entry signal is considered bullish when shorterterm moving averages are all above a longterm moving average aligning with a positive fractal valueexit strategythe strategy employs dynamic stoploss levels set at various moving averages allowing for partial exits when the price crosses below specific thresholds this helps manage the trade by locking in profits gradually a full exit might be triggered by strong reversal signals suggested by both fractal values and moving average trendsthis opensource strategy is available for the community to test adapt and utilize your feedback and modifications are welcome as we refine the approach based on collective user experiences,"{'Portfolio management', 'Fractal', 'Moving Averages'}",False,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False

stochastic oscillator and the 200period exponential moving average emato determine optimal entry points for long trades additionally the strategy uses the average true range atr for dynamic risk management to adapt to varying market conditions lets look in details for which purpose each indicator is used for and why it is used in this combination relative strength index rsi is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis to measure the speed and change of price movements in a financial market it helps traders identify whether an asset is potentially overbought overvalued or oversold undervalued which can indicate a potential reversal or continuation of the current trend how rsi works rsi tracks the strength of recent price changes it compares the average gains and losses over a specific period usually 14 periods to assess the momentum of an asset average gain is the average of all positive price changes over the chosen period it reflects how much the price has typically increased during upward movements average loss is the average of all negative price changes over the same period it reflects how much the price has typically decreased during downward movementsrsi calculates these average gains and losses and compares them to create a value between 0 and 100 if the rsi value is above 70 the asset is generally considered overbought meaning it might be due for a price correction or reversal downward conversely if the rsi value is below 30 the asset is considered oversold suggesting it could be poised for an upward reversal or recovery rsi is a useful tool for traders to determine market conditions and make informed decisions about entering or exiting trades based on the perceived strength or weakness of an assets price movementsthis strategy uses rsi as a shortterm trend approximation if rsi crosses over 50 it means that there is a high probability of shortterm trend change from downtrend to uptrend therefore rsi above 50 is our first trend filter to look for a long positionthe macd moving average convergence divergence is a popular momentum and trendfollowing indicator used in technical analysis it helps traders identify changes in the strength direction momentum and duration of a trend in an assets pricethe macd consists of three componentsmacd line this is the difference between a shortterm exponential moving average ema and a longterm ema typically calculated as macd line 12 period ema 26 period emasignal line this is a 9period ema of the macd line which helps to identify buy or sell signals when the macd line crosses above the signal line it can be a bullish signal suggesting a buy when it crosses below it can be a bearish signal suggesting a sellhistogram the histogram shows the difference between the macd line and the signal line visually representing the momentum of the trend positive histogram values indicate increasing bullish momentum while negative values indicate increasing bearish momentumthis strategy uses macd as a second shortterm trend filter when macd line crossed over the signal line there is a high probability that uptrend has been started therefore macd line above signal line is our additional shortterm trend filter in conjunction with rsi it decreases probability of following false trend change signalsthe stochastic indicator is a momentum oscillator that compares a securitys closing price to its price range over a specific period its used to identify overbought and oversold conditions the indicator ranges from 0 to 100 with readings above 80 indicating overbought conditions and readings below 20 indicating oversold conditionsit consists of two linesk the main line calculated using the formula currentcloselowestlowhighesthighlowestlow100 highest and lowest price taken for 14 periodsd a smoothed moving average of k often used as a signal linethis strategy uses stochastic to define the overbought conditions the logic here is the following we want to avoid long trades in the overbought territory because when indicator reaches it there is a high probability that the potential move is gonna be restrictedthe 200period ema is a widely recognized indicator for identifying the longterm trend direction the strategy only trades in the direction of this primary trend to increase the probability of successful trades for instance when the price is above the 200 ema only long trades are considered aligning with the overarching trend directiontherefore strategy uses combination of rsi and macd to increase the probability that price now is in shortterm uptrend stochastic helps to avoid the trades in the overbought 80 territory to increase the probability of opening long trades in the direction of a main trend and avoid local bounces we use 200 period ema atr is used to adjust the strategy risk management to the current market volatility if volatility is low we dont need the large stop loss to understand the there is a high probability that we made a mistake opening the trade user can setup the settings atr stop loss and atr trailing profit activation level to realize his own risk to reward preferences but the unique feature of a strategy is that after reaching trailing profit activation level strategy is trying to follow the trend until it is likely to be finished instead of using fixed risk management

513,Intramarket Difference Index Strategy,hi traders the idi strategy in laymans terms this strategy compares two indicators across markets and exploits their differencesnote it is best the two markets are correlated as then we know we are trading a short to long term deviation from both markets general trend with the assumption both markets will trend again sometime in the future thereby exhausting our trading opportunity import notes this strategy calculates trade position size independently ie risk per trade is controlled in the user inputs tab this means that the order size input in the properties tab will have no effect on the strategy why because this allows us to define custom position size algorithms which we can use to improve our risk management and equity growth over time here we have the option to have fixed quantity or fixed percentage of equity atr average true range based stops in addition to the turtle trading position size algorithmpyramiding does not work for this strategy similar to the order size input togeling this input will have no effect on the strategy as the strategy explicitly defines the maximum order size to be 1 this strategy is not perfect and as of writing of this post i have not traded this algo always take your time to backtests and debug the strategy the idi strategyby default this strategy pulls data from your current tv chart and then compares it to the base market be default btcusd the strategy pulls sma and rsi data from either market we call this the difference data standardizes the data solving the different unit problem across markets such that it is comparable and then differentiates the data calling the result of this transformation and difference the intramarket difference id the formula for the the id is id market1_diff_data market2_diff_data 1where marketi_diff_data diff_data atrj_marketi05 where i 1 2 and j the natural numbers excluding 0 formula 1 interpretation is the following when id 0 this means the current market outperforms the base marketwhen id 0 markets are at long run equilibriumwhen id 0 this means the current market underperforms the base marketto form the strategy we define one of two strategy types which are trend and mean revesion respectively trend casegiven the strategy type is equal to trend we define a threshold for which if the id crosses over we go long and if the id crosses under the negative of the threshold we go short the motivating idea is that the id is an indicator of the two symbols being out of sync and given we know volatility clustering momentum and mean reversion of anomalies to be a stylised fact of financial data we can construct a trading premise lets first talk more about this premise for some markets cryptocurrency markets synthetic symbols in tv the stylised fact of momentum is true this means that higher momentum is followed by higher momentum and given we know momentum to be a vector quantity with magnitude and direction this momentum can be both positive and negative ie when the id crosses above some threshold we make an assumption it will continue in that direction for some time before executing back to its long run equilibrium of 0 which is a reasonable assumption to make if the market are correlated for example for the btcusd ethusd pair if the id threshold inputs for ma and rsi based id thresholds are found under the intramarket difference index group ethusd outperforms btcusd we assume the momentum to continue so we go long ethusd in the standard case we would exit the market when the idi returns to its long run equilibrium of 0 for the positive case the id may return to 0 because eths difference data may have decreased or btcs difference data may have increased however in this strategy we will not define this as our exit condition why this is because we want to let our winners run to achieve this we define a trailing donchian channel stop loss along with a fixed atr based stop as our volatility proxy if we were too use the 0 exit the strategy may print a buy signal id threshold in the simple case market regimes may be used return to 0 and then print another buy signal and this process can loop may times this high trade frequency means we fail capture the entire market move lowering our profit furthermore on lower time frames this high trade frequencies mean we pay more transaction costs due to price slippage commission and bigask spread which means less profit by capturing the sum of many momentum moves we are essentially following the trend hence the trend following strategy type here we also print the idi with default strategy settings with the ma difference type we can see that by letting our winners run we may catch many valid momentum moves that results in a larger final pnl that if we would otherwise exit based on the equilibrium conditionvalid trades are denoted by solid green and red arrows respectively and all other valid trades which occur within the original signal are light green and red small arrows another examplenote if you would like to plot the idi separately copy and paste the following code in a new pine script indicator template pine scriptindicatoridi

signals before returning to a buy which again has the same implication less profit potentially because we exit early only for price to continue upwards hence missing the larger trend the image below showcases this cenario and again by allowing our winner to run we may capture more profit theoretically this should be clear mean reversion casewe stated prior that mean reversion of anomalies is an

529,Multi-Step FlexiSuperTrend - Strategy [presentTrading],at the heart of this endeavor is a passion for continuous improvement in the art of trading introduction and how it is differentthe multistep flexisupertrend strategy presenttrading is an advanced trading strategy that integrates the wellknown supertrend indicator with a nuanced and dynamic approach to market trend analysis unlike conventional supertrend strategies that rely on static thresholds and fixed parameters this strategy introduces multistep take profit mechanisms that allow traders to capitalize on varying market conditions in a more controlled and systematic mannerwhat sets this strategy apart is its ability to dynamically adjust to market volatility through the use of an incremental factor applied to the supertrend calculation this adjustment ensures that the strategy remains responsive to both minor and major market shifts providing a more accurate signal for entries and exits additionally the integration of multistep take profit levels offers traders the flexibility to scale out of positions locking in profits progressively as the market moves in their favorbtc 6hr longshort performance strategy how it works detailed explanationthe multistep flexisupertrend strategy operates on the foundation of the supertrend indicator but with several enhancements that make it more adaptable to varying market conditions the key components of this strategy include the supertrend polyfactor oscillator a dynamic normalization process and multistep take profit levels supertrend polyfactor oscillatorthe supertrend polyfactor oscillator is the heart of this strategy it is calculated by applying a series of supertrend calculations with varying factors starting from a defined starting factor and incrementing by a specified increment factor the indicator length and the chosen price source eg hlc3 hl2 are inputs to the oscillatorthe supertrend formula typically calculates an upper and lower band based on the average true range atr and a multiplier the factor these bands determine the trend direction in the flexisupertrend strategy the oscillator is enhanced by iteratively applying the supertrend calculation across different factors the iterative process allows the strategy to capture both minor and significant trend changesfor each iteration indexed by i the following calculations are performed1 atr calculation the average true range atr is calculated over the specified indicatorlength atr_i atrindicatorlength2 upper and lower bands calculation the upper and lower bands are calculated using the atr and the current factor upper band_i hl2 atr_i factor_i lower band_i hl2 atr_i factor_i here factor_i starts from startingfactor and is incremented by incrementfactor in each iteration3 trend determination the trend is determined by comparing the indicator source with the upper and lower bands trend_i 1 uptrend if indicatorsource upper band_i trend_i 0 downtrend if indicatorsource lower band_i otherwise the trend remains unchanged from the previous value4 output calculation the output of each iteration is determined based on the trend output_i lower band_i if trend_i 1 output_i upper band_i if trend_i 0this process is repeated for each iteration from 0 to 19 creating a series of outputs that reflect different levels of trend sensitivitylocal normalization processto make the oscillator values comparable across different market conditions the deviations between the indicator source and the supertrend outputs are normalized the normalization method can be one of the following1 maxmin normalization the deviations are normalized based on the range of the deviations normalized value_i deviation_i min deviation max deviation min deviation2 absolute sum normalization the deviations are normalized based on the sum of absolute deviations normalized value_i deviation_i sum of absolute deviationsthis normalization ensures that the oscillator values are within a consistent range facilitating more reliable trend analysisfor more detailshttpswwwtradingviewcomscripty9now915flexisupertrendstrategypresenttrading multistep take profit mechanismone of the unique features of this strategy is the multistep take profit mechanism this allows traders to lock in profits at multiple levels as the market moves in their favor the strategy uses three take profit levels each defined as a percentage increase for long trades or decrease for short trades from the entry price1 first take profit level calculated as a percentage increasedecrease from the entry price tp_level1 entry price 1 tp_level1 100 for long trades tp_level1 entry price 1 tp_level1 100 for short trades the strategy exits a portion of the position defined by tp_percent1 when this level is reached2 second take profit level similar to the first level but with a higher percentage tp_level2 entry price 1 tp_level2 100 for long trades tp_level2 entry price 1 tp_level2 100 for short trades the strategy exits another portion of the position tp_percent2 at this level3 third take profit level the final take profit level tp_level3 entry price 1 tp_level3 100 for long trades tp_level3 entry price 1 tp_level3 100 for short trades the remaining portion of the position tp_percent3 is exited at this levelthis multistep approach provides a balance between securing profits and allowing the remaining position to benefit from continued favorable market movement trade directionthe strategy allows traders to specify the trade direction through the tradedirection input the options are1 both the strategy will take both long and short positions based on the entry signals2 long the strategy will only take long positions3 short the strategy will only take short positionsthis flexibility enables traders to tailor the strategy to their market outlook or current trend analysis usageto use the multistep flexisupertrend strategy traders need to set the input parameters according to their trading style and market conditions the strategy is designed for versatility allowing for various market environments including trending and ranging marketstraders can also adjust the multistep take profit levels and percentages to match their risk management and profittaking preferences for example in highly volatile markets traders might set wider take profit levels with smaller percentages at each level to capture larger price movementsthe normalization method and the incremental factor can be finetuned to adjust the sensitivity of the supertrend polyfactor oscillator making the strategy more responsive to minor market shifts or more focused on significant trends default settingsthe default settings of the strategy are carefully chosen to provide a balanced approach between risk management and profit potential here is a breakdown of the default settings and their effects on performance1 indicator length 10 this parameter controls the lookback period for the atr calculation a shorter length makes the strategy more sensitive to recent price movements potentially generating more signals a longer length smooths out the atr reducing sensitivity but filtering out noise2 starting factor 0618 this is the initial multiplier used in the supertrend calculation a lower starting factor makes the supertrend bands closer to the price generating more frequent trend changes a higher starting factor places the bands further away filtering out minor fluctuations3 increment factor 0382 this parameter controls how much the factor increases with each iteration of the supertrend calculation a smaller increment factor results in more gradual changes in sensitivity while a larger increment factor creates a wider range of sensitivity across the iterations4 normalization method none the default is no normalization meaning the raw deviations are used normalization methods like maxmin or absolute sum can make the deviations more consistent across different market conditions improving the reliability of the oscillator5 take profit levels 2 8 18 these levels define the thresholds for exiting portions of the position lower levels eg 2 capture smaller profits quickly while higher levels eg 18 allow positions to run longer for more significant gains6 take profit percentages 30 20 15 these percentages determine how much of the position is exited at each take profit level a higher percentage at the first level locks in more profit early reducing exposure to market reversals lower percentages at higher levels allow for a portion of the position to benefit from extended

high probability reversal setups on lower time frame in the direction of the 1d time frame trend thats why its recommended to use this strategy on 30 min 4 hours time framesto have an approximation of 1d time frame trend strategy utilizes classical stochastic indicator the stochastic indicator is a momentum oscillator that compares a securitys closing price to its price range over a specific period its used to identify overbought and oversold conditions the indicator ranges from 0 to 100 with readings above 80 indicating overbought conditions and readings below 20 indicating oversold conditionsit consists of two linesk the main line calculated using the formula currentcloselowestlowhighesthighlowestlow100 highest and lowest price taken for 14 periods d a smoothed moving average of k often used as a signal linestrategy logic assumes that on 1d time frame its uptrend in k line is above the d line moreover we can consider long trade only in k line is below 80 it means that in overbought state the long trade will not be opened due to higher probability of pullback or even major trend reversal if these conditions are met we are going to our working lower time frame on the chosen time frame we remind you that for correct work of this strategy you shall use 30min 4h time frames macd line shall cross over its signal line the macd moving average convergence divergence is a popular momentum and trendfollowing indicator used in technical analysis it helps traders identify changes in the strength direction momentum and duration of a trend in a stocks pricethe macd consists of three componentsmacd line this is the difference between a shortterm exponential moving average ema and a longterm ema typically calculated as macd line12period ema26period signal line this is a

combination of indicator has been chosen lets briefly explain what is cci and hmathe commodity channel index cci is a momentumbased technical indicator used in trading to measure a securitys price relative to its average price over a given period developed by donald lambert in 1980 the cci is primarily used to identify cyclical trends in a security helping traders to spot potential buying or selling opportunitiesthe cci formula iscci typical price sma 0015 mean deviationtypical price tp this is calculated as the average of the high low and closing prices for the periodsimple moving average sma this is the average of the typical prices over a specific number of periodsmean deviation this is the average of the absolute differences between the typical price and the smathe result is a value that typically fluctuates between 100 and 100 though it is not bounded and can go higher or lower depending on the price movementthe hull moving average hma is a type of moving average that was developed by alan hull to improve upon the traditional moving averages by reducing lag while maintaining smoothness the goal of the hma is to create an indicator that is both quick to respond to price changes and less prone to whipsaws false signalshow the hull moving average is calculatedthe hull moving average is calculated using the following stepsweighted moving average wma the hma starts by calculating the weighted moving average wma of the price data over a period square root of n sqrtnspeed adjustment a wma is then calculated for half of the period n2 and this is multiplied by 2 to give more weight to recent priceslag reduction the wma of the full period n is subtracted from the doubled n2 wmafinal smoothing to smooth the result and reduce noise a wma is calculated for the square root of the period nthe formula can be represented ashman wmawman2 2 wman sqrtnthe weighted moving average wma is a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent data points making it more responsive to recent price changes than a simple moving average sma in a wma each data point within the selected period is multiplied by a weight with the most recent data receiving the highest weight the sum of these weighted values is then divided by the sum of the weights to produce the wmathis strategy leverages hma of user given period as a critical level which shall be broken to say that probability of trend change to the upside increased hma reacts faster than ema or sma to the price change thats why it increases chances to enter new trade earlier longterm period cci helps to have an approximation of midterm trend if its above 0 the probability of uptrend increases shortperiod cci allows to have an approximation of shortterm trend reversal from down to uptrend this approach increases chances to have a long trade setup in the direction of midterm trend when the shortterm trend starts to reverse atr is used to adjust the strategy risk management to the current

543,Bollinger Bands Enhanced Strategy,overviewthe common practice of using bollinger bands is to use it for building mean reversion or squeeze momentum strategies in the current script bollinger bands enhanced strategy we are trying to combine the strengths of both strategies types it utilizes bollinger bands indicator to buy the local dip and activates trailing profit system after reaching the user given number of average true ranges atr also it uses 200 period ema to filter trades only in the direction of a trend strategy can execute only long trades unique featurestrailing profit system strategy uses user given number of atr to activate trailing take profit if price has already reached the trailing profit activation level scrip will close long trade if price closes below bollinger bands middle lineconfigurable trading periods users can tailor the strategy to specific market windows adapting to different market conditions major trend filter strategy utilizes 100 period ema to take trades only in the direction of a trendflexible risk management users can choose number of atr as a stop loss by default 175 for trades this is flexible approach because atr is recalculated on every candle therefore stoploss readjusted to the current volatilitymethodologyfirst of all script checks if currently price is above the 200period exponential moving average ema ema is used to establish the current trend script will take long trades on if this filtering system showing us the uptrend then the strategy executes the long trade if candles low below the lower bollinger band to calculate the middle bollinger line we use the standard 20period simple moving average sma lower band is calculated by the substruction from middle line the standard deviation multiplied by user given value by default 2when long trade executed script places stoploss at the price level below the entry price by user defined number of atr by default 175 this stoploss level recalculates at every candle while trade is open according to the current candle atr value also strategy set the trailing profit activation level at the price above the position average price by user given number of atr by default 225 it is also recalculated every candle according to atr value when price hit this level script plotted the triangle with the label strong uptrend and start trail the price at the middle bollinger line it also started to be plotted as a green line when price close below this trailing level script closes the long trade and search for the next trade opportunity risk managementthe strategy employs a combined and flexible approach to risk management it allows positions to ride the trend as long as the price continues to move favorably aiming to capture significant price movements it features a userdefined atr stop loss parameter to mitigate risks based on individual risk tolerance by default this stoploss is set to a 175atr drop from the entry point but it can be adjusted according to the traders preferences there is no fixed take profit but strategy allows user to define user the atr trailing profit activation parameter by default this stoploss is set to a 225atr growth from the entry point but it can be adjusted according to the traders preferences justification of methodologythis strategy leverages bollinger bangs indicator to open long trades in the local dips if price reached the lower band there is a high probability of bounce here is an issue during the strong downtrend price can constantly goes down without any significant correction thats why we decided to use 200period ema as a trend filter to increase the probability of opening long trades during major uptrend onlyusually bollinger bands indicator is using for mean reversion or breakout strategies both of them have the disadvantages the mean reversion buys the dip but closes on the return to some mean value therefore it usually misses the major trend moves the breakout strategies usually have the issue with too high buy price because to have the breakout confirmation price shall break some price level therefore in such strategies traders need to set the large stoploss which decreases potential reward to risk ratioin this strategy we are trying to combine the best features of both types of strategies script utilizes ate atr to setup the stoploss and trailing profit activation levels atr takes into account the current volatility therefore when we setup stoploss with the usergiven number of atr we increase the probability to decrease the number of false stop outs the trailing profit concept is trying to add the beat feature from breakout strategies and increase probability to stay in trade while uptrend is developing when price hit the trailing profit activation level script started to trail the price with middle line if bollinger bands indicator only when candle closes below the middle line script closes the long trade backtest

over for longs or crosses under for shorts a mediumlonger length moving average all of which are customizable this strategy can work on any timeframe however the daily is the timeframe used for the default settings and screenshots as it was designed to be a multiday swing strategy once a signal has been confirmed with a candle close based on user options the strategy will enter the trade on the open of the next candlethe crossover strategy is nothing new to trading but what can make this strategy unique and helpful is the addition of further confirmation points atr based stop loss and take profit targets optional early exit criteria customizable to your needs and style and just about everything visual can be toggled onoff this strategy is based on a trend ma indicator and a momentum macd indicator while a volumebased indicator is not shown here one could consider using their favorite from that category to further compliment the signal ideait should be noted that depending on the time frame directions chosen the signal options confirmation options and exit options selected that a ticker may not produce more than 100 trades on the back test depending on your style and frequency one could consider adjusting options andor testing multiple tickers it should also be noted that this strategy simply tests the underlying stock prices not options contracts and of course testing this strategy against historical data does not assume that the same results will occur in future price actionshoutout given to ripsters clouds indicator as pieces of that code were taken and modified to

557,Fractal Breakout Trend Following Strategy,overviewthe fractal breakout trend following strategy is a trendfollowing system which utilizes the willams fractals and alligator to execute the long trades on the fractals breakouts which have a high probability to be the new uptrend phase beginning this system also uses the normalized average true range indicator to filter trades after a large moves because its more likely to see the trend continuation after a consolidation period strategy can execute only long trades unique featurestrend and volatility filtering system strategy uses williams alligator to filter the countertrend fractals breakouts and normalized average true range to avoid the trades after large moves when volatility is highconfigurable trading periods users can tailor the strategy to specific market windows adapting to different market conditionsflexible risk management users can choose the stoploss percent by default 3 for trades but strategy also has the dynamic stoploss level using down fractalsmethodologythe strategy places stop order at the last valid fractal breakout level validity of this fractal is defined by the williams alligator indicator if at the moment of time when price breaking the last fractal price is higher than alligators teeth line 8 period sma shifted 5 bars in the future this is a valid breakout moreover strategy has the additional volatility filtering system using normalized atr it calculates the average normalized atr for last userdefined number of bars and if this value lower than the userdefined threshold value the long trade is executedwhen trade is opened script places the stop loss at the price higher of two levels user defined stoploss from the position entry price or down fractal validation level the down fractal is valid with the rule opposite as the up fractal validation price shall break to the downside the last down fractal below the willians alligators teeth line strategy has no fixed take profit exit level changes with the down fractal validation level if price is in strong uptrend trade is going to be active until last down fractal is not valid strategy closes trade when price hits the down fractal validation level risk managementthe strategy employs a combined approach to risk managementit allows positions to ride the trend as long as the price continues to move favorably aiming to capture significant price movements it features a userdefined stoploss parameter to mitigate risks based on individual risk tolerance by default this stoploss is set to a 3 drop from the entry point but it can be adjusted according to the traders preferencesjustification of methodologythis strategy leverages williams fractals to open long trade when price has broken the key resistance level to the upside this resistance level is the last up fractal and is shall be broken above the williams alligators teeth line to be qualified as the valid breakout according to this strategy the alligator filtering increases the probability to avoid the false breakouts against the current trend moreover strategy has an additional filter using average true rangeatr indicator if average value of atr for the last userdefined number of bars is lower than userdefined threshold strategy can open the long trade according to open trade condition above the logic here is following we want to open trades after period of price consolidation inside the range because before and after a big move price is more likely to be in sideways but we need a trend move to have a profit another one important feature is how the exit condition is defined on the one hand strategy has the userdefined stoploss 3 below the entry price by default its made to give users the opportunity to restrict their losses according to their risktolerance on the other hand strategy utilizes the dynamic exit level which is defined by down fractal activation if we assume the breaking up fractal is the beginning of the uptrend breaking down fractal can be the start of downtrend phase we dont want to be in long trade if there is a high probability of reversal to the downside this approach helps to not keep open trade

582,Korneev Reverse RSI,rethinking the legendary relative strength index by john welles wilderthe essence of the new approach lies in the reverse use of the socalled overbought and oversold zones in his 1978 book new concepts in technical trading systems where the rsi mechanism was thoroughly described wilder writes that one way to use the oscillator is to open a long position when the rsi drops into oversold territory below 30 and to open a short position when the rsi rises to overbought levels above 70 however backtesting this strategy with such inputs yields rather mediocre resultsbased on the calculation formula the rsi calculates the rate of price change over a certain period therefore overbought and oversold zones will have relative significance relative to the set calculation period it is no coincidence that the word relative was added to the name of the oscillator it is worth accepting as an axiom the assertion that the price of an asset is fair at every moment in timeessentially the rsi calculates the strength of a trend if the oscillator value is above 70 it is highly likely that an upward movement is occurring in the market therefore in the current strategy a long position is opened precisely at the moment of greatest buyer strength when rsi 80 ie in the direction of the trend since countertrend trading with the rsi has proven to be ineffective the position is closed after the buyers lose their advantage and the rsi drops to 40the strategy is recommended to be used only with long positions as short positions show negative results the strategy uses a moving average for the rsi with a period of 14 to smooth the oscillator dataпереосмысление легендарного осциллятора relative strength index джона уэллса уайлдерасуть нового подхода заключается в реверсивном использовании так называемых зон перекупленности и перепроданности в своей книге от 1978 года new concepts in tecnical trading systems в которой был подробно описан механизм работы rsi уайлдер пишет что один из способов использования осциллятора открытие длинной позиции при снижении rsi в перепроданность ниже 30 и открытие короткой позиции при повышении rsi до перекупленности выше 70 однако бэктест стратегии с такими вводными дает весьма посредственные результатыисходя из формулы расчета rsi рассчитывает скорость изменения цены за определенный период поэтому зоны перекупленности и перепроданности будут иметь относительное значение относительно установленного периода расчета не зря ведь в названии осциллятора было добавлено слово относительной стоит принять за аксиому утверждение что цена актива справедлива в каждый момент временипо сути rsi рассчитывает силу тренда если значение осциллятора выше 70 то на рынке с высокой долей вероятности происходит восходящее движение поэтому в текущей стратегии открытие лонга происходит именно в момент наибольшей силы покупателей когда rsi 80 то есть в сторону тренда поскольку контртрендовая торговля по rsi показала свою несостоятельность закрытие позиции происходит после того как покупатели теряют преимущество и rsi снижается до 40стратегию рекомендуется использовать только с длинными позициями поскольку короткие позиции показывают отрицательный результат в стратегии используется скользящая средняя для rsi с периодом 14 для сглаживания данных осциллятора,"{'wilder', 'Relative Strength Index (RSI)', 'relativestregthindex'}",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False

592,Trailing Take Profit - Close Based,descriptionthis script demonstrates a new approach to the trailing take profittrailing take profit is a pricefollowing technique when used instead of setting a limit order for the take profit target exiting from your position at the specified price a stop order is conditionally set when the take profit target is reached then the stop price aka trailing price is placed below the take profit target at a distance defined by the user percentagewise on regular time intervals the stop price gets updated by following the trail barrier price high by default upwards when the current price hits the stop price you exit the trade check the chart for more detailsthis script demonstrates how to implement the closebased trailing take profit logic for long positions but it can also be applied for short positions if the logic is reversed noteto generate some entries and showcase the trailing take profit technique this script uses the crossing of two moving averages please keep in mind that you should not relate the backtesting results you see in the strategy tester tab with the success of the technique itselfthis is not a complete strategy per se and the backtest results are affected by many parameters that are outside of the scope of this publication if you choose to use this new approach of the trailing take profit in your logic you have to make sure that you are backtesting the whole strategy comparisonin contrast to my older trailing take profit publication where the trailing take profit implementation was tickbased this new approach is closebased meaning that the update of the stop price occurs at the bar close instead of every tickwhile comparing the realtime results of the two implementations is like comparing apples to oranges because they have different dynamic behavior the new approach offers better consistency between the backtesting results and the realtime resultsby updating the stop price on every bar close you do not rely on the backtester assumptions anymore check the reasoning section below for more infothe new approach resembles the conditional trailing exit technique where the condition is true when the current price crosses over the take profit target then the stop order is placed at the trailing price and it gets updated on every bar close to follow the barrier price high on the other hand the older tickbased approach had more tight dynamics since the trailing price gets updated on every tick leaving less room for price fluctuations by making it more probable to reach the trailing price reasoningthis new closebased approach addresses several practical issues the older tickbased approach had those issues arise mainly from the technicalities of the tv backtester more specifically due to the assumptions the broker emulator makes for the price action of the history bars the backtesting results in the tv backtester are exaggerated and depending on the timeframe the backtesting results look way better than they are in realitythe effect above and the inability to reason about the performance of a strategy separated people into two groups those who never use this feature because they couldnt know for sure the actual effect it might have in their strategy even if it turned out to be more profitable and those who abused this type of repainting behavior to show off and hijack some boosts from the community by boasting about the fake results of their strategieseven if there are ways to evaluate the effectiveness of the tickbased approach that is applied in an existing strategy this is out of the topic of this publication it requires extra effort to do the analysis using this closedbased approach we can have more predictable results without surprises caveatssince this approach updates the trailing price on bar close you must wait for at least one bar to close after the price crosses over the take profit target,"{'Pine utilities', 'trailingtakeprofit', 'moving_average', 'takeprofit', 'trailing'}",False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

location information making it especially useful for detecting changes or anomalies in complex signalsthe discrete fourier transform dft is a mathematical technique that transforms discrete data from the time domain into its corresponding representation in the frequency domain this process involves breaking down a signal into its individual frequency components thereby exposing the amplitude and phase characteristics inherent in each frequency elementthis indicator utilizes the concept of ehlers universal oscillator and displays a histogram offering critical insights into the prevailing levels of market noise the ehlers universal oscillator is grounded in a statistical model that captures the erratic and unpredictable nature of market movements through the application of this

oscillatorprice zone oscillator measures if the most recent closing price is above or below the preceding closing pricevolume zone oscillator is volume multiplied by the 1 or 1 depending on the difference of the preceding 2 close prices and smoothed with exponential moving averagewhat does this meanif the vzo is above 0 and vzo is rising we have a bullish trend most likelyif the vzo is below 0 and vzo is falling we have a bearish trend most likelyrising means that vzo on close is higher than the previous dayfalling means that vzo on close is lower than the previous daywhat if vzo is falling above 0 lineit means we have a high probability of a bearish trendthus the indicator returns 0 and strategy closes all its positions when falling above 0 or rising bellow 0 and we combine higher and lower timeframes to gauge the trendin the next image you can see that trend is negative on 4h negative on 12h and positive on 1d that means trend is negativei am sorry the chart is a bit

623,Bitcoin Momentum Strategy,this is a very simple longonly strategy ive used since december 2022 to manage my bitcoin position im sharing it as an opensource script for other traders to learn from the code and adapt it to their liking if they find the system concept interestinggeneral overviewalways do your own research and backtesting this script is not intended to be traded blindly no script should be and ive done limited testing on other markets beyond ethereum and btc its just a template to tweak and play with and make into ones ownthe results shown in the strategy tester are from bitcoins inception so as to get a large sample size of trades and potential returns have diminished significantly as btc has grown to become a mega cap asset but the script includes a date filter for backtesting and it has still performed solidly in recent years speaking from personal experience using it myself dyor with the date filterthe main advantage of this system in my opinion is in limiting the max drawdown significantly versus buy hodl theoretically much better returns can be made by just holding but thats also a good way to lose 70 of your capital in the inevitable bear markets also speaking from experiencein saying all of that the future is fundamentally unknowable and past results in no way guarantee future performancesystem conceptcapture as much bitcoin upside volatility as possible while sidestepping downside volatility as quickly as possiblethe system uses a simple but clever momentumstyle trailing stop technique i learned from one of my trading mentors who uses this approach on momentumtrendfollowing stock market systemsbasically the system ratchets up the stoploss to be much tighter during high bearish volatility to protect open profits from downside moves but loosens the stop loss during sustained bullish momentum to let the position rideit is invested most of the time unless btc is trading below its 20week ema in which case it stays in cashusdt to avoid holding through bear markets it only trades one position no pyramiding and does not trade short but can easily be tweaked to do whatever you like if you know what youre doing in pine default parametershtf weekly chartema 20periodatr 5periodbar lookback 7entry rule 1bitcoins current price must be trading above its highertimeframe ema weekly 20 emaentry rule 2bitcoin must not be in caution condition no large bearish volatility swings recently enter at next bars open if conditions are met and we are not already involved in a tradecaution conditiondefined as true if btcs recent 7bar swing high minus current bars low is 15x atr or daily close daily 20ematrailing stopstop is trailed 1 atr from recent swing high or 20 of atr if in caution condition ie 02 atrexit on next bar open upon a close below stop loss i typically use a limit order to open exit trades as close to the open price as possible to reduce slippage but the strategy script uses market orders ive never had any issues getting filled on limit orders close to the market price with btc on the daily timeframe but if the exchange has relatively low slippage ive found market orders work fine too without much impact on the results particularly since btc has consistently remained above 20k and highly liquidcost of tradingthe script uses no leverage and a default total roundtrip commission of 03 which is what i pay on my exchange based on their tier structure but this can vary widely from exchange to exchange and higher commission fees will have a significantly negative impact on realized gains so make sure to always input the correct theoretical commission cost when backtesting any script static slippage is difficult to estimate in the strategy tester given the wide range of prices liquidity btc has experienced over the years and it largely depends on position size i set it to 150 points per buy or sell as btc is currently very liquid on the exchange i trade and i use limit orders where possible to enterexit positions as close as possible to the markets open price as it significantly limits my slippage but again this can vary a lot from exchange to exchange for better or worse and if btc volatility is high at the time of execution this can have a negative impact on slippage and therefore real performance so make sure to adjust it according to your exchanges tendencies tax considerations should also be made based on shortterm trade frequency if crypto profits are treated as a cgt event in your regionsummarya simple but effective and fairly robust system that achieves the goals i set for it from my preliminary testing it appears it may also work on altcoins but it might need a bit of tweakingloosening with the trailing stop distance as the default parameters are designed to work with bitcoin which obviously behaves very differently to smaller cap assetsgood luck out there,"{'Portfolio management', 'momentumtrading', 'system', 'Exponential Moving Average

624,Inside Candle Strategy,introductionthe inside candle breakout strategy leverages the concept of inside candles as a primary signal for potential breakouts unlike common trendfollowing or scalping strategies this method focuses on the volatility squeeze indicated by inside candles and aims to capture the momentum that follows these periods of consolidation the strategys originality lies in its specific integration of timeframes for signal detection and its application across diverse market conditions without relying on conventional trend indicatorsstrategy description and mechanicsinside candle identification at the heart of this strategy is the detection of inside candles defined as candles fully contained within the range of the preceding candle this pattern signifies a temporary balance between buyers and sellers often preceding significant price movements the strategy scans for these candles within a userspecified timeframe in the input section of the settings of the strategy allowing for tailored signal generation based on individual trading preferencesentry points and market entries upon identifying an inside candle and only once this candle closes the strategy prepares to enter a trade in the direction of the breakout trades are executed in the timeframe selected on the chart ensuring that entry points are aligned with realtime market movements this process highlights the strategys adaptability making it suitable for various trading styles from day trading to swing tradingoverlay indicator for enhanced market analysis accompanying the breakout signals is an overlay indicator comprising two moving averages and a volatility cloud this feature serves as a secondary tool for market analysis offering insights into the prevailing market trend and volatility levels while it doesnt influence the entry or exit signals directly it provides traders with additional context for refining their decisions enhancing the strategys utility this assistance tool is composed by one moving average and a second line which is calculated adding or subtracting the historical volatility of the asset on the moving average depending on his momentumstrategy results and

performance across a variety of market conditionsstrategy components inside candles an inside candle occurs when a candles high and low are completely contained within the high and low of the previous candle this pattern indicates a period of consolidation or indecision in the market often preceding a significant price movement the strategy detects inside candles based on the userselected timeframe allowing traders to capture potential breakoutsindicator overlays moving average a simple moving average sma is calculated over a userdefined length average length providing a dynamic baseline to gauge the markets direction the strategy offers an option show moving average to display or hide this moving average on the chart giving traders control over the visual complexity volatility measurement alongside the moving average the strategy assesses market volatility using the standard deviation of the closing prices over the same period defined by the average length the moving average is adjusted upwards or downwards by this volatility measure creating a dynamic channel that reflects the current market conditions color gradients for volatility the strategy uses a color gradient to fill the area between the moving average and its volatilityadjusted counterpart this gradient visually represents the volatility level transitioning from gray low volatility to a lighter shade higher volatility aiding in the assessment of market sentiment and volatilitytrading entries long entry a long position is triggered when the closing price exceeds the high of an inside candle indicating potential bullish momentum the strategy places a stoploss at the low of the inside candle and sets a takeprofit level based on the predefined riskreward ratio rr ratio short entry conversely a short position is initiated when the closing price falls below the low of an inside candle suggesting bearish pressure a stoploss is set at the high of the inside candle with the takeprofit level adjusted according to the riskreward ratiocustomization settings timeframe traders can select the desired timeframe for inside candle detection tailoring the strategy to fit various trading styles and time horizons rr ratio the riskreward ratio is adjustable allowing traders to manage the potential risk and return of each trade according to their risk tolerance average length

635,Long EMA Strategy with Advanced Exit Options,this strategy is designed for traders seeking a trendfollowing system with a focus on precision and adaptabilitycore strategy conceptthe essence of this strategy lies in use of exponential moving averages emas to identify potential long buy positions based on the relative positions of shortterm mediumterm and longterm emas the use of emas is a classic yet powerful approach to trend detection as these indicators smooth out price data over time emphasizing the direction of recent price movements and potentially signaling the beginning of new trendscustomizable parameters ema periods users can define the periods for three emas longterm mediumterm and shortterm allowing for a tailored approach to capture trends based on individual trading styles and market conditions volatility filter an optional average true range atrbased volatility filter can be toggled on or off when activated it ensures that trades are only entered when market volatility exceeds a userdefined threshold aiming to filter out entries during lowvolatility periods which are often characterized by indecisive market movements trailing stop loss a trailing stop loss mechanism expressed as a percentage of the highest price achieved since entry provides a dynamic way to manage risk by allowing profits to run while cutting losses ema exit condition this advanced exit option enables closing positions when the shortterm ema crosses below the mediumterm ema serving as a signal that the immediate trend may be reversing close below ema exit an additional exit condition which is disabled by default allows positions to be closed if the price closes below a userselected ema this provides an extra layer of flexibility and risk management catering to traders who prefer to exit positions based on specific ema thresholdsoperational mechanicsupon activation the strategy evaluates the current price in relation to the set emas a long position is considered when the current price is above the longterm ema and the shortterm ema is above the mediumterm ema this setup aims to identify moments where the price momentum is strong and likely to continuethe strategys versatility is further enhanced by its optional settings the volatility filter adjusts the sensitivity of the strategy to market movements potentially improving the quality of the entries during volatile market conditions the average true range atr is a key component of this filter providing a measure of market volatility by calculating the average range between the high and low prices over a specified number of periods heres how you can adjust the volatility filter settings for various market conditions focusing on filtering out lowvolatility marketssetting examples for volatility filter1 high volatility markets eg cryptocurrencies certain forex pairsatr periods 14 defaultatr multiplier setting the multiplier to a lower value such as 10 or 12 can be beneficial in highvolatility markets this sensitivity allows the strategy to react to volatility changes more quickly ensuring that youre entering trades during periods of significant movement2 medium volatility markets eg major equity indices mediumvolatility forex pairsatr periods 14 defaultatr multiplier a multiplier of 15 default is often suitable for medium volatility markets it provides a balanced approach ensuring that the strategy filters out lowvolatility conditions without being overly restrictive3 low volatility markets eg some commodities lowvolatility forex pairsatr periods increasing the atr period to 20 or 25 can smooth out the volatility measure making it less sensitive to shortterm fluctuations this adjustment helps in focusing on more significant trends in inherently stable marketsatr multiplier raising the multiplier to 20 or even 25 increases the threshold for volatility effectively filtering out lowvolatility conditions this setting ensures that the strategy only triggers trades during periods of relatively higher volatility which are more likely to result in significant price movementshow to use the volatility filter for lowvolatility marketsfor traders specifically interested in filtering out lowvolatility markets the key is to adjust the atr multiplier to a higher level this adjustment increases the threshold required for the market to be considered sufficiently volatile for trade entries heres a stepbystep guideadjust the atr multiplier increase the atr multiplier to create a higher volatility threshold a multiplier of 20 to 25 is a good starting point for very lowvolatility marketsfinetune the atr periods consider lengthening the atr calculation period if you find that the strategy is still entering trades in undesirable lowvolatility conditions a longer period provides a more averagedout measure of volatility which might better suit your needsmonitor and adjust volatility is not static and market conditions can change regularly review the performance of your strategy in the context of current market volatility and adjust the settings as necessarybacktest in different conditions before applying the strategy live backtest it across different market conditions with your adjusted settings this process helps ensure that your approach to filtering lowvolatility conditions aligns with your trading objectives and risk toleranceby finetuning the volatility filter settings according to the specific characteristics of the market youre trading in you can enhance the performance of this strategy the trailing stop loss and ema exit conditions provide two layers of exit strategies focusing on capital preservation and profit maximizationvisualizationsfor clarity and ease of use the strategy plots the three

638,Crypto MVRV ZScore - Strategy [PresentTrading],introduction and how it is differentthe crypto valuation extremes mvrv zscore strategy presenttrading represents a cuttingedge approach to cryptocurrency trading leveraging the market value to realized value mvrv zscore this metric is pivotal for identifying overvalued or undervalued conditions in the crypto market particularly bitcoin it assesses the current market valuation against the realized capitalization providing insights that are not apparent through conventional analysisbtcusd 6h longshort performancelocal strategy how it works detailed explanationthe strategy leverages the market value to realized value mvrv zscore specifically designed for cryptocurrencies with a focus on bitcoin this metric is crucial for determining whether bitcoin is currently undervalued or overvalued compared to its historical realized price below is an indepth explanation of the strategys components and calculationsconceptual foundation market capitalization mc this represents the total dollar market value of bitcoins circulating supply it is calculated as the current price of bitcoin multiplied by the number of coins in circulation realized capitalization rc unlike mc which values all coins at the current market price rc is computed by valuing each coin at the price it was last moved or traded essentially it is a summation of the value of all bitcoins priced at the time they were last transacted mvrv ratio this ratio is derived by dividing the market capitalization by the realized capitalization the ratio of mc to rc mvrv ratio mc rc a ratio greater than 1 indicates that the current price is higher than the average price at which all bitcoins were purchased suggesting potential overvaluation conversely a ratio below 1 suggests undervaluation mvrv zscore calculationthe zscore is a statistical measure that indicates the number of standard deviations an element is from the mean for this strategy the mvrv zscore is calculated as followsmvrv zscore mc rc standard deviation of mc rcthis formula quantifies bitcoins deviation from its normal valuation range offering insights into market sentiment and potential price reversals spread zscore for trading signalsthe strategy refines this approach by calculating a spread zscore which adjusts the mvrv zscore over a specific period default 252 days this is done to smooth out shortterm market volatility and focus on longerterm valuation trends the spread zscore is calculated as followsspread zscore market zscore mvvr ratio sma of spread standard deviation of spreadwhere sma of spread is the simple moving average of the spread over the specified period spread refers to the difference between the market zscore and the mvrv ratio trading signals long entry condition a long buy signal is generated when the spread zscore crosses above the long entry threshold indicating that bitcoin is potentially undervalued short entry condition a short sell signal is triggered when the spread zscore falls below the short entry threshold suggesting overvaluationthese conditions are based on the premise that extreme deviations from the mean as indicated by the zscore are likely to revert to the mean over time presenting opportunities for strategic entry and exit points practical applicationtraders use these signals to make informed decisions about opening or closing positions in the bitcoin market by quantifying market valuation extremes the strategy aims to capitalize on the cyclical nature of price movements identifying highprobability entry and exit points based on historical valuation norms trade directiona unique feature of this strategy is its configurable trade direction users can specify their preference for engaging in long positions short positions or both this flexibility allows traders to tailor the strategy according to their risk tolerance market outlook or trading style making it adaptable to various market conditions and trader objectives usageto implement this strategy traders should first adjust the input parameters to align with their trading preferences and risk management practices these parameters include the trade direction zscore calculation period and the thresholds for long and short entries once configured the strategy automatically generates trading signals based on the calculated spread zscore providing clear indications for potential entry and exit pointsit is advisable for traders to backtest the strategy under different market conditions to validate its effectiveness and adjust the settings as necessary continuous monitoring and adjustment are crucial as market dynamics evolve over time default settings trade direction both allows for both long and short positions zscore calculation period 252 days approximately one trading year capturing a comprehensive market cycle long entry threshold 0382 indicative of moderate undervaluation short entry threshold 0382 signifies moderate overvaluationthese default settings are designed to balance sensitivity to market valuation extremes with a pragmatic approach to trade execution they aim to filter out noise and focus on

performancelocal strategy how it works detailed explanationthe presenttrend rmi synergy strategy intricately combines the relative momentum index rmi and a custom supertrend indicator to create a powerful tool for traders relative momentum index rmithe rmi is a variation of the relative strength index rsi but instead of using price closes against itself it measures the momentum of up and down movements in price relative to previous prices over a given period the rmi for a period length n is calculated as followsrmi 100 100 1 udwhere u is the average upward price change over n periods d is the average downward price change over n periodsthe rmi oscillates between 0 and 100 with higher values indicating stronger upward momentum and lower values suggesting stronger downward momentumrmi 21rmi 42for more information rmi trend sync strategy presenttrading presenttrend indicatorthe presenttrend indicator combines the average true range atr with a moving average to determine trend direction and dynamic support or resistance levels the presenttrend for a period length m and a multiplier f is defined as upper band ma atr x f lower band ma atr x f where ma is the moving average of the close price over m periods atr is the average true range over the same period f is the multiplier to adjust the sensitivitythe trend direction switches when the price crosses the presenttrend

when the rmi exceeds a threshold say 60 indicating a strong bullish momentum and when the price is above the presenttrend confirming an uptrend short entry occurs when the rmi drops below a threshold say 40 showing strong bearish momentum and the price is below the present trend indicating a downtrendexit conditions with dynamic trailing stop long exit initiated when the price crosses below the lower presenttrend band or when the rmi falls back towards a neutral level suggesting a weakening of the bullish momentum short exit executed when the price crosses above the upper presenttrend band or when the rmi rises towards a neutral level indicating a reduction in bearish momentumequations for dynamic trailing stop for long positions the exit price is set at the lower supertrend band once the entry condition is met for short positions the exit price is determined by the upper supertrend band postentrythese dynamic trailing stops adjust as the market moves providing a method to lock in

648,Turtle Trader Strategy,turtle trader strategy introduction this strategy is based on the well known turtle trader strategy that has proven itself over the years it sends long and short signals with pyramid orders of up to 5 meaning that the strategy can trigger up to 5 orders in the same direction good risk and money managementits important to note that the strategy combines 2 systems working together s1 and s2 lets describe the specific features of this strategy1 position size position size is very important for turtle traders to manage risk properly this position sizing strategy adapts to market volatility and to account gains and losses its based on atr average true range which can also be called n its length is per default 20atr20 previous_atr2019 actual_true_range20the number of units to buy is unit 1 accountatr20dollar_per_pointwhere account is the actual account value and dollar_per_point is the variation in dollar of the asset with a 1 point movedepending on your risk aversion you can increase the percentage of your account but turtle traders default to 1 if you trade contracts units must be rounded down by defaultthere is also an additional rule to reduce the risk if the value of the account falls below the initial capital in this case and only in this case account in the unit formula must be replace by account actual_accountactual_accountinitial capital2 open a position 2 systems are working together system 1 entering a new 20 day breakoutsystem 2 entering a new 55 day breakouta breakout is a new high or new low if its a new high we open long position and vice versa if its a new low we enter in short positionwe add an additional rule system 1 breakout is ignored if last longshort position was a winnersystem 2 all signals are takenthis additional rule allows the trader to be in the major trends if the system 1 signal has been skipped if a signal for system 1 has been skipped and next candle is also a new 20 day breakout s1 doesnt give a signal we have to wait s2 signal or wait for a candle that doesnt make a new breakout to reactivate s13 pyramid orders turtle strategy allows us to add extra units to the position if the price moves in our favor ive configured the strategy to allow up to 5 orders to be added in the same direction so if the price varies from 05atr20 we add units with the position size formula note that the value of account will be replaced by remaining_account ie the cash remaining in our account after subtracting the value of open positions4 stop loss we set a stop loss at 15atr20 below the entry price for longs and above the entry price for shorts if pyramid units are added the stop is increaseddecreased by 05atr20 note that if sl is configured for a loss of more than 10 we set the sl to 10 for the first entry order to avoid big losses this configuration does not work for pyramid orders as sl moves by 05atr205 exit signals system 1 exit long on a 10 day lowexit short on a 10 day highsystem 2 exit long on a 20 day lowexit short on a 20 day high6 what types of orders are placed to enter in a position stop orders are placed meaning that we place orders that will be automatically triggered by the signal at the exact breakout price stop loss and exit signals are also stop orders pyramid orders are market orders which will be triggered at the opening of the next candle to avoid repaintingparameters risk of capital percentage used in the position size formula default is 1atr period atr length used to calculate atr default is 20stop atr parameters used to fix stop loss default is 15 meaning that stop loss will be set at buy_price 15atr20 for long and buy_price 15atr20 for short turtle traders default is 2 but 15 is better for cryptocurrency as there is a huge volatilitys1 long system 1 breakout length for long default is 20s2 long system 2 breakout length for long default is 55s1 long exit system 1 breakout length to exit long default is 10s2 long exit system 2 breakout length to exit long default is 20s1 short system 1 breakout length for short default is 15s2 short system 2 breakout length for short default is 55s1 short exit system 1 breakout length to exit short default is 7s2 short exit system 2 breakout length to exit short default is 20initial capital 1000fees interactive broker fees apply to this strategy they are set at 018 of the trade valueslippage 3 ticks or 003 per trade corresponds to the latency time between the moment the signal is received and the moment the order is executed by the brokerpyramiding number of orders that can be passed in the same direction default is 5important turtle traders dont trade crypto for this specific asset type i modify some parameters such as sl and short s1 in order to maximize return while limiting drawdown this strategy is the most optimal on btcusd in 1d timeframe with the parameters set per default if you want to use this strategy for a different crypto please adapt parameters note its important to note that the first entry order long or short will be the largest subsequent pyramid orders will have fewer units than the first order weve set a maximum sl for the first order of 10 meaning that you wont lose more than 10 of the value of your first order however it is possible to lose more on your pyramid orders as the sl is increaseddecreased by 05atr20 which does not secure a loss of more than 10 on your pyramid orders the risk remains well managed because the value of these orders is less than the value of the first order remain vigilant to this small detail and adjust your risk according to your risk aversion enjoy the strategy and dont forget to take the trade,"{'Volatility Stop', 'Portfolio

656,Megabar Breakout (Range & Volume & RSI),hey therethis strategy is based on the idea that certain events lead to what are called megabars megabars are bars that have a very large range and volume i wanted to verify whether these bars indicate the start of a trend and whether one should follow the trendsummary of the codethe code is based on three indicators the range of the bar the volume of the bar and the rsi when certain values of these indicators are met a megabar is identified the direction of the megabar indicates the direction in which we should tradewhy do i combine these indicatorsi want to identify special bars that have the potential to mark the beginning of a breakout therefore a bar needs to exhibit high volume have a large range huge price movement and we also use the relative strength index rsi to assess potential momentum only if all three criteria are met within one candle do we use this as an identifier for a megabarexplanation of drawings on the chartas you can see there is a green background on my chart the green background symbolizes the time when im entering a trade only if a megabar happens during that time im ready to enter a trade the time is between 6 am and 4 pm cet its just because i prefer that time also the strategy draws an error every time a megabar happens based on vol and range only not on the rsi that makes it pretty easy to go through your chart and check the biggest bars manually you can activate or deactivate these settings via the input data of the strategywhen do we enter a tradewe wait for a megabar to happen during our trading session if the megabar is bullish we open a long trade at the opening price of the next candle if the megabar is bearish we open a short trade at the opening price of the next candlewhere do we put our take profit stop lossthe default setting is tp 40 pips and sl 30 pips in that case we are always trading with a riskreward ratio of 133 by default you can easily change these settings via the input data of the strategystrategy resultsthe criteria for megabars were chosen by me in a way that makes megabars something special they are not intended to occur too frequently as the fundamental idea of this strategy would otherwise not hold this results in only 37 closed trades within the last 12 months if you change the criterias for a megabar to a milder one you will create more megabars and therefore more trades its up to you i have adapted this strategy to the 30minute chart of the eurusd in the evaluation we consider a period of 12 months which i believe is sufficientmy default settings for the indicators look like thisavg length vol 20avg multiplier vol 3avg length range 20avg multiplier range 4value sma rsi for long trades 50value sma rsi for short trades 70important the current performance overview does not display the results of these settings please change the settings to my default ones so that you can see how i use this strategyi do not recommend trading this strategy without further testing the script is meant to reflect a basic idea and be used as a tool to identify megabars i have made this strategy completely public so that it can be further developed one can take this framework and test it on different timeframes and different markets,"{'breakouttrading', 'rsibreakout', 'rangetrading', 'breakoutsignal', 'breakoutbar', 'Candlestick analysis', 'rangebreakout', 'megabar'}",True,True,True,True,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

658,The Flash-Strategy with Minervini Stage Analysis Qualifier,the flashstrategy momentumrsi emacrossover atr with minervini stage analysis qualifierintroductionwelcome to a comprehensive guide on a cuttingedge trading strategy ive developed designed for the modern trader seeking an edge in todays dynamic markets this strategy which ive honed through my years of experience in the trading arena stands out for its unique blend of technical analysis and market intuition tailored specifically for use on the tradingview platformas a trader with a deep passion for the financial markets my journey began several years ago driven by a relentless pursuit of a trading methodology that is both effective and adaptable my background in trading spans various market conditions and asset classes providing me with a rich tapestry of experiences from which to draw this strategy is the culmination of that journey embodying the lessons learned and insights gained along the waythe cornerstone of this strategy lies in its ability to generate precise long signals in a stage 2 uptrend and equally accurate short signals in a stage 4 downtrend this approach is rooted in the principles of trend following and momentum trading harnessing the power of key indicators such as the momentumrsi ema crossover and average true range atr what sets this strategy apart is its meticulous design which allows it to adapt to the everchanging market conditions providing traders with a robust tool for navigating both bullish and bearish scenariosthis strategy was born out of a desire to create a trading system that is not only highly effective in identifying potential trade setups but also straightforward enough to be implemented by traders of varying skill levels its a reflection of my belief that successful trading hinges on clarity precision and disciplined execution whether you are a seasoned trader or just beginning your journey this guide aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to harness the full potential of this strategy in your trading endeavorsin the following sections we will delve deeper into the mechanics of the strategy its implementation and how to make the most out of its features join me as we explore the nuances of a strategy that is designed to elevate your trading to the next levelstagespecific signal generationa distinctive feature of this trading strategy is its focus on generating long signals exclusively during stage 2 uptrends and short signals during stage 4 downtrends this approach is based on the widely recognized market cycle theory which divides the market into four stages stage 1 accumulation stage 2 uptrend stage 3 distribution and stage 4 downtrend by aligning the signal generation with these specific stages the strategy aims to capitalize on the most dynamic and clearcut market movements thereby enhancing the potential for profitable trades1 long signals in stage 2 uptrends characteristics of stage 2 stage 2 is characterized by a strong uptrend where prices are consistently rising this stage typically follows a period of accumulation stage 1 and is marked by increased investor interest and bullish sentiment in the market criteria for long signal generation long signals are generated during this stage when the technical indicators align with the characteristics of a stage 2 uptrend rationale for stagespecific signals by focusing on stage 2 for long trades the strategy seeks to enter positions during the phase of strong upward momentum thus riding the wave of rising prices and investor optimism this stagespecific approach minimizes exposure to less predictable market phases like the consolidation in stage 1 or the indecision in stage 32 short signals in stage 4 downtrends characteristics of stage 4 stage 4 is identified by a pronounced downtrend with declining prices indicating prevailing bearish sentiment this stage typically follows the distribution phase stage 3 and is characterized by increasing selling pressure criteria for short signal generation short signals are generated in this stage when the indicators reflect a strong bearish trend rationale for stagespecific signals targeting stage 4 for shorting capitalizes on the markets downward momentum this tactic aligns with the natural market cycle allowing traders to exploit the downward price movements effectively by doing so the strategy avoids the potential pitfalls of shorting during the early or late stages of the market cycle where trends are less defined and more susceptible to reversalsin conclusion the strategys emphasis on stagespecific signal generation is a testament to its sophisticated understanding of market dynamics by tailoring the long and short signals to stages 2 and 4 respectively it leverages the most compelling phases of the market cycle offering traders a clear and structured approach to aligning their trades with dominant market trendsstrategy overviewat the heart of this trading strategy is a philosophy centered around capturing market momentum and trend efficiency the core objective is to identify and capitalize on clear uptrends and downtrends thereby allowing traders to position themselves in sync with the markets prevailing direction this approach is grounded in the belief that aligning trades with these dominant market forces can lead to more consistent and profitable outcomesthe strategy is built on three foundational components each playing a critical role in the decisionmaking process1 momentumrsi relative strength index the momentumrsi is a pivotal element of this strategy its an enhanced version of the traditional rsi finetuned to better capture the strength and velocity of market trends by measuring the speed and change of price movements the momentumrsi provides invaluable insights into whether a market is potentially overbought or oversold suggesting possible entry and exit points this indicator is especially effective in filtering out noise and focusing on substantial market moves2 ema exponential moving average crossover the ema crossover is a crucial component for trend identification this strategy employs two emas with different timeframes to determine the market trend when the shorterterm ema crosses above the longerterm ema it signals an emerging uptrend suggesting a potential long entry conversely a crossover below indicates a possible downtrend hinting at a short entry opportunity this simple yet powerful tool is key in confirming trend directions and timing market entries3 atr average true range the atr is instrumental in assessing market volatility this indicator helps in understanding the average range of price movements over a given period thus providing a sense of how much a market might move on a typical day in this strategy the atr is used to adjust stoploss levels and to gauge the potential risk and reward of trades it allows for more informed decisions by aligning trade management techniques with the current volatility conditionsthe synergy of these three components the momentumrsi ema crossover and atr creates a robust framework for this trading strategy by combining momentum analysis trend identification and volatility assessment the strategy offers a comprehensive approach to navigating the markets whether its capturing a strong trend in its early stages or identifying a potential reversal this strategy aims to provide traders with the tools and insights needed to make wellinformed strategically sound trading decisionsdetailed component analysisthe efficacy of this trading strategy hinges on the synergistic functioning of its three key components the momentumrsi ema crossover and average true range atr each component brings a unique perspective to the strategy contributing to a wellrounded approach to market analysis1 momentumrsi relative strength index definition and function the momentumrsi is a modified version of the classic relative strength index while the traditional rsi measures the velocity and magnitude of directional price movements the momentumrsi amplifies aspects that reflect trend strength and momentum significance in identifying trend strength this indicator excels in identifying the strength behind a markets move a high momentumrsi value typically indicates strong bullish momentum suggesting the potential continuation of an uptrend conversely a low momentumrsi value signals strong bearish momentum possibly indicative of an ongoing downtrend application in strategy in this strategy the momentumrsi is used to gauge the underlying strength of market trends it helps in filtering out minor fluctuations and focusing on significant movements providing a clearer picture of the markets true momentum2 ema exponential moving average crossover definition and function the ema crossover component utilizes two exponential moving averages of different timeframes unlike simple moving averages emas give more weight to recent prices making them more responsive to new information contribution to market direction the interaction between the shortterm and longterm emas is key to determining market direction a crossover of the shorter ema above the longer ema is an indicator of an emerging uptrend while a crossover below signals a developing downtrend application in strategy the ema crossover serves as a trend confirmation tool it provides a clear visual representation of the markets direction aiding in the decisionmaking process for entering long or short positions this component ensures that trades are aligned with the prevailing market trend a crucial factor for the success of the strategy3 atr average true range definition and function the atr is an indicator that measures market volatility by calculating the average range between the high and low prices over a specified period role in assessing market volatility the atr provides insights into the typical market movement within a given timeframe offering a measure of the markets volatility higher atr values indicate increased volatility while lower values suggest a calmer market environment application in strategy within this strategy the atr is instrumental in tailoring risk management techniques particularly in setting stoploss levels by accounting for the markets volatility the atr ensures that stoploss orders are placed at levels that are neither too tight risking premature exits nor too loose exposing to excessive riskin summary the combination of momentumrsi ema crossover and atr in this trading strategy provides a comprehensive toolkit for market analysis the momentumrsi identifies the strength of market trends the ema crossover confirms the market direction and the atr guides in risk management by assessing volatility together these components form the backbone of a strategy designed to navigate the complexities of the financial markets effectively1 signal generation process combining indicators the strategy operates by synthesizing signals from the momentumrsi ema crossover and atr indicators each indicator serves a specific purpose the momentumrsi gauges trend momentum the ema crossover identifies the trend direction and the atr assesses the markets volatility criteria for signal validation for a signal to be considered valid it must meet specific criteria set by each of the three indicators this multilayered approach ensures that signals are not only based on one aspect of market behavior but are a result of a comprehensive analysis2 conditions for long positions uptrend confirmation a long position signal is generated when the shorterterm ema crosses above the longerterm ema indicating an uptrend momentumrsi alignment alongside the ema crossover the momentumrsi should indicate strong bullish momentum this is typically represented by the momentumrsi being at a high level confirming the strength of the uptrend atr consideration the atr is used to finetune the entry point and set an appropriate stoploss level in a low volatility scenario as indicated by the atr the stoploss can be set tighter closer to the entry point3 conditions for short positions downtrend confirmation conversely a short position signal is indicated when the shorterterm ema crosses below the longerterm ema signaling a downtrend momentumrsi confirmation the momentumrsi should reflect strong bearish momentum usually seen when the momentumrsi is at a low level this confirms the bearish strength of the market atr application the atr again plays a role in determining the stoploss level for the short position higher volatility as indicated by a higher atr would warrant a wider stoploss to accommodate larger market swingsby adhering to these mechanics the strategy aims to ensure that each trade is entered with a high probability of success aligning with the markets current momentum and trend the integration of these indicators allows for a holistic market analysis providing traders with clear and actionable signals for both entering and exiting tradescustomizable parameters in the strategyflexibility and adaptability are key features of this trading strategy achieved through a range of customizable parameters these parameters allow traders to tailor the strategy to their individual trading style risk tolerance and specific market conditions by adjusting these parameters users can finetune the strategy to optimize its performance and align it with their unique trading objectives below are the primary parameters that can be customized within the strategy1 momentumrsi settings period the lookback period for the momentumrsi can be adjusted a shorter period makes the indicator more sensitive to recent price changes while a longer period smoothens the rsi line offering a broader view of the momentum overboughtoversold thresholds users can set their own overbought and oversold levels which can help in identifying extreme market conditions more precisely according to their trading approach2 ema crossover settings timeframes for emas the strategy uses two emas with different timeframes traders can modify these timeframes choosing shorter periods for a more responsive approach or longer periods for a more conservative one source data the choice of price data close open high low used in calculating the emas can be varied depending on the traders preference3 atr settings lookback period adjusting the lookback period for the atr impacts how the indicator measures volatility a longer period may provide a more stable but less responsive measure while a shorter period offers quicker but potentially more erratic readings multiplier for stoploss calculation this parameter allows traders to set how aggressively or conservatively they want their stoploss to be in relation to the atr valuehere are the standard settings httpswwwtradingviewcomxaadlxekg,"{'Centered Oscillators',

unlike traditional methods it calculates deviations between a chosen indicator source such as price or average and a moving average with a variable length this flexibility is achieved through a unique combination of a starting factor and an increment factor allowing the moving average to adapt dynamically within a specified range this strategy provides a more responsive and nuanced view of market trends setting it apart from standard trading methodologiesbtc 8h lslocal strategy how it works detailed explanationthe flexima variance tracker developed by presenttrading stands at the forefront of trading strategies distinguished by its adaptive and multifaceted approach to market analysis this strategy intricately weaves various technical elements to construct a comprehensive trading logic heres an indepth professional breakdownfoundation on variablelength moving averagescentral to this strategy is the concept of variablelength moving averages mas unlike traditional mas with a fixed period this strategy dynamically adjusts the length of the ma based on a starting factor and an incremental factor this approach allows the strategy to adapt to market volatility and trend strength more effectivelyeach ma iteration offers a distinct temporal perspective capturing shortterm price movements to longterm trends this aggregation of various time frames provides a richer and more nuanced market analysis essential for making informed trading decisionsdeviation analysis and normalizationthe strategy calculates deviations of the price or the chosen indicator source from each of these mas these deviations are pivotal in identifying the immediate market direction relative to the average trend captured by each mato standardize these deviations for comparability they undergo a normalization process the choice of normalization method maxmin or absolute sum can significantly influence the interpretation of market conditions offering distinct insights into price movements and trend strengthnormalization absolute sumcomposite oscillator constructiona composite oscillator is derived from the median of these normalized deviations the median serves as a balanced and robust central trend indicator minimizing the impact of outliers and market noiseadditionally the standard deviation of these deviations is computed providing a measure of market volatility this volatility indicator is crucial for assessing market risk and can guide traders in setting appropriate stoploss and takeprofit levelsintegration with supertrend indicatorthe flexima strategy integrates the supertrend indicator renowned for its effectiveness in identifying trend direction and reversals the supertrends incorporation enhances the strategys ability to filter out false signals and confirm genuine market trends the supertrend toolkit is made by quantiluxethis combination of the variablelength ma oscillator with the supertrend indicator forms a potent duo offering traders a

668,Backtesting Module,do you often find yourself creating new strategy scripts for each trading system are you unable to focus on generating new systems due to fatigue and time loss incurred in the process heres a potential solution the backtesting module introductionevery trading system is based on four basic conditions long entry long exit short entry and short exit which are typically defined as boolean series in pine scriptif you can define the conditions generated by your trading system as a series of integers it becomes possible to use these variables in different scripts in efficient ways pine script is a convenient language that allows you to use the integer output of one indicator as a source in anotherthe backtesting module is a dynamic strategy script designed to adapt to your signals it boasts two notable features it produces a backtest report using the entry and exit variables you define it not only serves for system testing but also to combine independent signals into a single system this functionality enables to create complex strategies and report on their successthe module tests golden and death cross signals by default when you enter your own conditions the default signals will be neutralized the methodology is described belowpreparationthere are three simple steps to connect your own indicator to the module step 1firstly you must define entry and exit variables in your own script lets elucidate it with a straightforward example consider a system generating long and short signals based on the intersections of two moving averages consequently our conditions would be as followspine script signalslong tacrossovertasmaclose 14 tasmaclose 28short tacrossundertasmaclose 14 tasmaclose 28now the question is how can we convert boolean variables into integer variables the answer is conditional ternary block defined as followspine script entry exit long_entry long 1 0long_exit short 1 0short_entry short 1 0short_exit long 1 0the mechanics of the entry exit variables are simple the variable takes on a value of 1 when your trading system generates the signal and if your system does not produce any signal variable returns 0 in this example you see how exit signals can be generated in a trading system that only contains entry signals if you have a system with original exit signals you can also use them directly please mind the notes section belowstep 2to utilize the entry exit variables as source in another script they must be plotted on the chart therefore the final detail to include in the script containing your trading system would be as followspine script plot the outputplotlong_entry long entry displaydisplaydata_window editablefalseplotlong_exit long exit displaydisplaydata_window editablefalseplotshort_entry short entry

along with your trading systemindicator then set the outputs of your system long entry long exit short entry short exit as source in the module thats itfeatures originality primarily this script has been created to provide you with an easy and practical method when testing your trading system i thought it might be nice to visualize a few useful results the backtesting module provides insights into the outcomes of both long and short trades by computing the number of trades and the success percentage through the trade parameter users can specify the market direction in which the indicator is permitted to initiate positions users have the flexibility to define the date range for the test there are optional features allowing users to plot entry prices on the chart and customize bar colors the report and the test date range are presented in a table on the chart screen the entry price can be monitored in the data window note that results are based on realized returns and the open trade is not included in the displayed results the only exception is the unrealized pnl result in the tablestrategy settingsthe default parameters are as follows initial balance 10000 in units of currency quantity 10 of equity commission 004 slippage 0 dataset all bars in the chartfor a realistic backtest result you should size trades to only risk sustainable amounts of equity do not risk more than 510 on a trade and always configure your commission and slippage parameters according to pessimistic scenariosnotes this script is intended solely for development purposes and itll will be available for all the indicators i publish in this version of the module all order types are designed as market orders the exit size is the sum of the entry size as your trading conditions grow more intricate you might need to define the outputs of your system in alternative ways the method outlined in this description is tailored for straightforward signal structures additionally depending on the structure of your trading system the backtest module may require further development this encompasses stoploss takeprofit specific exit orders quantity margin and risk management calculations i am considering releasing improvements that consider these options in future versions an example of how complex trading signals can be generated is the ott collection if youre interested in seeing how the

672,London BreakOut Classic,hey there this is my first time publishing a strategy the strategy is based on the london breakout idea an incredibly popular concept with abundant information available onlinelet me summarize the london breakout strategy in a nutshell it involves identifying key price levels based on the tokyo session before the london session starts typically these key levels are the high and low of the previous tokyo session if a breakout occurs during the london session you simply follow the trendthe purpose of this codeafter conducting my research i came across numerous posts videos and articles discussing the london breakout strategy i aimed to automatically test it myself to verify whether the claims made by these socalled trading gurus are accurate or not consequently i wrote this script to gain an understanding of how this strategy would perform if i were to follow its basic settings blindlyexplanation of drawings on the chartred or green box a box is drawn on our chart displaying the exact range of the tokyo trading session this box is colored red if the trend during the session was downward and green if it was upward the box is always drawn between the high and the low between 000 am and 700 am utc you can change the settings via the inputs session time tokyo session time zonegreen background the green background represents the london trading session my code allows us to make entries only during this time if we havent entered a trade any pending orders are canceled ive also programmed a timeout at 11 pm to ensure every trade is closed before the new tokyo session beginsred line the red line is automatically placed in the middle of our previous tokyo range this line acts as our stop loss if we cross this line after entering a trade but before reaching our take profit well be stopped outwhen do we enter a tradewe wait for a candle body to close outside of the previous tokyo range to enter a trade with the opening of the next candle we only enter one trade per daywhere do we put our take profitthe code calculates the exact distance between our entry point and the stop loss we are trading a riskreward ratio of 11 by default meaning our take profit is always the same number of pips away from our entry as the stop loss the stop loss is always defined by the red line on the chart you can change the riskreward ratio via the inputs setting crv to see how the result changeswhat is the purpose of this scripti wanted to backtest the london breakout strategy to see how it actually works therefore i wrote this code so that everybody can test it for themselves you can change the settings and see how the result changes typically you should test this strategy on forex markets and on either 1min 5 min or 15 min timeframewhat are the resultsover the last 36 months over 100 trades trading the strategy with my default settings hasnt proven to be very successful consequently i do not recommend trading this strategy blindly the purpose of this code is to provide you with a foundation for the london breakout strategy allowing you to modify and enhance it according to your preferences if youre contemplating whether to give it a try you can assess the results from the past months by using this code as a starting point,"{'breakouttrading', 'breakoutsignal', 'london', 'Trend Analysis', 'londonsession', 'breakout', 'londonbreakout', 'londondaybreak', 'breakouttrade'}",False,True,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True

conditionsdeveloping an understanding of the conditions set within a trading strategy is essential for traders to maximize its potential here we delve deep into the logic behind these conditions using the supertrend advance strategy as our focal pointbasic logic behind conditionsevery strategy is built around a set of conditions that provide buy or sell signals the conditions are based on mathematical or statistical methods and are rooted in the study of historical price data the fundamental idea is to recognize patterns or behaviors that have been profitable in the past and might be profitable in the futurebuy and sell conditions1 buy conditions usually formulated around bullish signals or indicators suggesting upward price momentum2 sell conditions centered on bearish signals or indicators indicating downward price momentumsimple strategythe simple strategy could involve using just the supertrend indicator here buy when price closes above the supertrend line sell when price closes below the supertrend linepullback strategythis strategy capitalizes on price retracements buy when the price retraces to the supertrend line after a bullish signal and is supported by another bullish indicator sell when the price retraces to the supertrend line after a bearish signal and is confirmed by another bearish indicatorindicators usedema exponential moving average logic ema gives

signal while crossing below can be bearishcci commodity channel index logic cci compares a securitys average price change with its average price variation a cci value above 100 may mean the price is overbought while below 100 might signify an oversold conditionand othersas the strategy expands or contracts more indicators might be added or removed the crucial point is to understand the core logic behind each ensuring they align with the strategys objectiveslogic behind each indicator1 ema emphasizes recent price movements provides dynamic support and resistance levels2 rsi indicates overbought and oversold conditions based on recent price changes3 macd showcases momentum and direction of a trend by comparing two emas4 cci measures the difference between a securitys price change and its average price changeunderstanding strategy conditions is not just about knowing when to buy or sell but also about comprehending the underlying market dynamics that those conditions represent as you

volume to support the movement volume can validate the strength of a signal3 confirmation use multiple indicators or chart patterns to confirm the entry point for instance a buy signal from the supertrend indicator can be confirmed with a bullish macd crossoverposition exit strategiesa successful exit strategy will lock in profits and minimize losses here are some strategies1 fixed time exit exiting after a predetermined period2 percentagebased profit target exiting after a certain percentage gain3 indicatorbased exit exiting when an indicator gives an opposing signalpercentagebased sltp stop loss sl set a fixed percentage below the entry price to limit potential losses example a 2 sl on an entry at 100 would trigger a sell at 98 take profit tp set a fixed percentage above the entry price to lock in gains example a 5 tp on an entry at 100 would trigger a sell at 105supertrendbased sltp stop loss sl position the sl at the supertrend line if the price breaches this line it could indicate a trend reversal take profit tp one could set the tp at a point where the supertrend line flattens or turns indicating a possible slowdown in momentumswing highlowbased sltp stop loss sl for a long position set the sl just below the recent swing low for a short position set it just above the recent swing high take profit tp for a long position set the tp near a recent swing high or resistance for a short position near a swing low or supportand other methods1 trailing stop loss this dynamic sl adjusts with the price movement locking in profits as the trade moves in your favor2 multiple take profits divide the position into segments and set multiple tp levels securing profits in stages3 opposite signal exit exit when another reliable indicator gives an opposite signaltrade

bearish downward movestrend linestrend lines are straight lines drawn on a chart that connect a series of price points their significance1 uptrend line drawn along the lows representing support a break below might indicate a trend reversal2 downtrend line drawn along the highs indicating resistance a break above might suggest the start of a bullish trendfilled areasthese represent a range between two values on a chart usually shaded or colored for instance1 bollinger bands the area between the upper and lower band is filled giving a visual representation of volatility2 volume profile can show a filled area representing the amount of trading activity at different price levelsstop loss and take profit linesthese are horizontal lines representing predetermined exit points for trades1 stop loss line indicates the level at which a trade will be automatically closed to limit losses positioned according to the traders risk tolerance2 take profit line denotes the target level to lock in profits set according to potential resistance for long trades or support for short trades or other technical factorstrailing stop linesa trailing stop is a dynamic form of stop loss that moves with the price on a chart1 for long trades starts below the entry price and moves up with the price but remains static if the price falls ensuring profits are locked in2 for short trades starts above the entry price and moves down with the price but remains static if the price risesvisual representations offer traders a clear organized view of market dynamics familiarity with these tools ensures that

togethersupertrend this is primarily a trendfollowing indicator it provides traders with buy and sell signals based on the volatility of the price when combined with other indicators it can filter out noise and give more weight to strong confirmed trendsema exponential moving average ema gives more weight to recent price data it can be used to identify the direction and strength of a trend when the price is above the ema its generally considered bullish and vice versarsi relative strength index an oscillator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions by crossreferencing with other indicators like ema or macd traders can spot potential reversals or confirmations of a trendmacd moving average convergence divergence this indicator identifies changes in the strength direction momentum and duration of a trend in a stocks price when the macd line crosses above the signal line it can be a bullish sign and when it crosses below it can be bearish pairing macd with supertrend can provide dual confirmation of a trendcci commodity channel index initially developed for commodities cci can indicate overbought or oversold conditions

680,Bollinger Bands Strategy,bollinger bands strategy introduction this strategy is based on the famous bollinger bands these are constructed using a standard moving average sma and the standard deviation of past prices the theory goes that 90 of the time the price is contained between these two bands if it were to break out this would mean either a reversal or a continuation however when a reversal occurs the movement is weak whereas when a continuation occurs the movement is substantial and profits can be interesting were going to use bb to take advantage of this strong upcoming movement while managing our risks reasonably theres also a money management method for reinvesting part of the profits or reducing the size of orders in the event of substantial lossesbollinger bands the construction of bollinger bands is straightforward first plot the sma of the price with a length specified by the user then calculate the standard deviation to measure price dispersion in relation to the mean using this formula stdv p1 avg2 p2 avg2 pn avg2 n12to plot the two bollinger bands we then add a userdefined number of standard deviations to the initial sma the default is to add 2 the result is upper_band sma 2stdvlower_band sma 2stdvwhen the price leaves this channel defined by the bands we obtain buy and sell signalsparameters bb length this is the length of the bollinger bands ie the length of the sma used to plot the bands and the length of the price series used to calculate the standard deviation the default is 120standard deviation multipler adds or subtracts this number of times the standard deviation from the initial sma default is 2sma exit signal length exit signals for winning and losing trades are triggered by another sma this parameter defines the length of this sma the default is 110max risk per trade in its the maximum percentage the user can lose in one trade the default is 6fixed ratio this is the amount of gain or loss at which the order quantity is changed the default is 400 meaning that for each 400 gain or loss the order size is increased or decreased by a userselected amountincreasing order amount this is the amount to be added to or subtracted from orders when the fixed ratio is reached the default is 200 which means that for every 400 gain 200 is reinvested in the strategy on the other hand for every 400 loss the order size is reduced by 200initial capital 1000fees interactive broker fees apply to this strategy they are set at 018 of the trade valueslippage 3 ticks or 003 per trade corresponds to the latency time between the moment the signal is received and the moment the order is executed by the brokerimportant a bot has been used to test the different parameters and determine which ones maximize return while limiting drawdown this strategy is the most optimal on btcusd in 8h timeframe with the following parameters bb length 120standard deviation multipler 2sma exit signal length 110max risk per trade in 6enter rules the entry rules are simpleif close upper_band its a long signalif close lower_band its a short signalexit rules if we are long and close sma_exit position is closedif we are short and close sma_exit the position is closedpositions close automatically if they lose more than 6 to limit riskrisk management this strategy is subject to losses we manage our risk using the exit sma or using a sl sets to 6 this sma gives us exit signals when the price closes below or above thus limiting losses if the signal arrives too late the position is closed after a loss of 6money management the fixed ratio method was used to manage our gains and losses for each gain of an amount equal to the fixed ratio value we increase the order size by a value defined by the user in the increasing order amount parameter similarly each time we lose an amount equal to the value of the fixed ratio we decrease the order size by the same userdefined value this strategy increases both performance and drawdownnote please note that the strategy is backtested from 20170101 as the timeframe is 8h this strategy is a mediumlongterm strategy thats why only 51 trades were closed be careful as the test sample is small and performance may not necessarily reflect what may happen in the futureenjoy the strategy and dont forget to take the trade,"{'Standard Deviation', 'Bollinger Bands (BB)', 'Bands and Channels'}",False,True,True,True,False,False,True,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

682,RSI & Backed-Weighted MA Strategy,rsi ma strategy introduction this strategy is based on two wellknown indicators that work best together the relative strength index rsi and the moving average ma were going to use the rsi as a trendfollower indicator rather than a reversal indicator as most are used to to the signals sent by the rsi well add a condition on the charts ma filtering out irrelevant signals and considerably increasing our winning rate this is a mediumlongterm strategy theres also a money management method enabling us to reinvest part of the profits or reduce the size of orders in the event of substantial lossesrsi the rsi is one of the bestknown and most widely used indicators in trading its purpose is to warn traders when an asset is overbought or oversold it was designed to send reversal signals but were going to use it as a trend indicator by increasing its length to 20 the rsi formula is as follows rsi n 100 100 1 h nl nwith n the length of the rsi hn the average of days closing above the open and ln the average of days closing below the openma the moving average is also widely used in technical analysis to smooth out variations in an asset the sma formula is as follows sma n p1 p2 pn nwhere n is the length of the mahowever an sma does not weight any of its terms which means that the price 10 days ago has the same importance as the price 2 days ago or todays price thats why in this strategy we use a rwma ie a backweighted moving average it weights old prices more heavily than new ones this will enable us to limit the impact of shortterm variations and focus on the trend that was dominating the rwma used weights the 4 most recent terms by 100 4n4130the other oldest terms by weight_4_first_term130so the older terms are weighted 130 more than the more recent ones the moving average thus traces a trend that accentuates past values and limits the noise of shortterm variationsparameters rsi length lenght of rsi default is 20ma type

694,Machine Learning: SuperTrend Strategy TP/SL [YinYangAlgorithms],the supertrend is a very useful indicator to display when trends have shifted based on the average true range atr its underlying ideology is to calculate the atr using a fixed length and then multiply it by a factor to calculate the supertrend when the close crosses the supertrend it changes directionthis strategy features the traditional supertrend calculations with machine learning ml and take profit stop loss applied to it using ml on the supertrend allows for the ability to sort data from previous supertrend calculations we can filter the data so only previous supertrends that follow the same direction and are within the distance bounds of our knearest neighbour knn will be added and then averaged this average can either be achieved using a mean or with an exponential calculation which puts added weight on the initial source take profits and stop losses are then added to the ml supertrend so it may capitalize on momentum changes meanwhile remaining in the trend during consolidationby applying machine learning logic and adding a take profit and stop loss to the traditional supertrend we may enhance its underlying calculations with potential to withhold the trend better the main purpose of this strategy is to minimize losses and false trend changes while maximizing gains this may be achieved by quick reversals of trends where strategic small losses are taken before a large trend occurs with hopes of potentially occurring large gain due to this logic the winloss ratio of this strategy may be quite poor as it may take many small marginal losses where there is consolidation however it may also take large gains and capitalize on strong momentum movementstutorialin this example above we can get an idea of what the default settings may achieve when there is momentum it focuses on attempting to hit the trailing take profit which moves in accord with the supertrend just with a multiplier added when momentum occurs it helps push the supertrend within it which on its own may act as a smaller trailing take profit of its own accord weve highlighted some key points from the last example to better emphasize how it works as you can see the white circle is where profit was taken from the ml supertrend simply from it attempting to switch to a bullish buy trend however that was rejected almost immediately and we went back to our bearish sell trend that ended up resulting in our take profit being hit yellow circle this strategy aims to not only capitalize on the small profits from supertrend to supertrend but to also capitalize when the momentum is so strong that the price moves x away from the supertrend and is able to hit the take profit location this take profit addition to this strategy is crucial as momentum may change state shortly after such drastic price movements and if we were to simply wait for it to come back to the supertrend we may lose out on lots of potential profitif you refer to the yellow circle in this example youll notice what was talked about in the summaryoverview above during periods of consolidation when there is little momentum and price movement and we dont have any stop loss activated you may see signal flashing signal flashing is when there are buy and sell signals that keep switching back and forth during this time you may be taking small losses this is a normal part of this strategy when a signal has finally been confirmed by momentum is when this strategy shines and may produce the profit you desireyou may be wondering what causes these jagged like patterns in the supertrend its due to the ml logic and it may be a little confusing but essentially what is happening is the fast moving supertrend and the slow moving supertrend are creating knn min and max distances that are extreme due to usually parabolic movement this causes fewer values to be added to and averaged within the ml and causes less smooth and more exponential drastic movements this is completely normal and one of the perks of using knearest neighbor for ml calculations if you dont know the min and max distance allowed is derived from the most recent0 index of data array to knn length so only supertrend values that exhibit distances within these minmax will be allowed into the averagesince the knn ml logic can cause these exponential movements in the supertrend they likewise affect its take profit the take profit may benefit from this movement like displayed in the example above which helped it claim profit before then exhibiting upwards movementby default our stop loss multiplier is kept quite low at 00000025 keeping it low may help to reduce some signal flashing while not taking extra losses more so than not using it at all however if we increase it even more to say 0005 like is shown in the example above it can really help the trend keep momentum please note although previous results dont imply future results at 00000025 stop loss we are currently exhibiting 6927 profit while at 0005 stop loss we are exhibiting 3354 profit this just goes to show that although there may be less signal flashing it may not result in more profitwe will conclude our tutorial here hopefully this has given you some insight as to how machine learning combined with trailing take profit and stop loss may have positive effects on the supertrend when turned into a strategysettingssupertrendatr length atr length used to create the original supertrendfactor multiplier used to create the original supertrendstop loss multiplier 0 dont use stop loss stop loss can be useful for helping to prevent false signals but also may result in more loss when hit and less profit when switching trendstake profit multiplier take profits can be useful within the supertrend strategy to stop the price reverting all the way to the stop loss once its been profitablemachine learningonly factor same trend direction very useful for ensuring that data used in knn is not manipulated by different supertrend directional data please note it doesnt affect knn exponentialrationalized source type should we rationalize only a specific source all or

699,[blackcat] L1 MartinGale Scalping Strategy,martingale strategy is a popular money management strategy used in trading it is commonly applied in situations where the trader aims to recover from a losing streak by increasing the position size after each lossin the martingale strategy after a losing trade the trader doubles the position size for the next trade this is done in the hopes that a winning trade will eventually occur which will not only recover the previous losses but also generate a profitthe idea behind the martingale strategy is to take advantage of the law of averages by increasing the position size after each loss the strategy assumes that eventually a winning trade will occur which will not only cover the previous losses but also generate a profit this can be especially appealing for traders looking for a quick recovery from a losing streakhowever it is important to note that the martingale strategy carries significant risks if a trader experiences a prolonged losing streak or lacks sufficient capital the strategy can lead to substantial losses the strategys reliance on the assumption of a winning trade can be dangerous as there is no guarantee that a winning trade will occur within a certain timeframetraders considering implementing the martingale strategy should carefully assess their risk tolerance and thoroughly understand the potential drawbacks it is crucial to have a solid risk management plan in place to mitigate potential losses additionally traders should be aware that the strategy may not be suitable for all market conditions and may require adjustments based on market volatilityin summary the martingale strategy is a money management strategy that involves increasing the position size after each loss in an attempt to recover from a losing streak while it can offer the potential for quick recovery it also comes with significant risks that traders should carefully consider before implementing it in their trading approachthe martingale scalping strategy is a trading strategy designed to generate profits through frequent trades it utilizes a combination of moving average crossovers and crossunders to generate entry and exit signals the strategy is implemented in tradingviews pine script languagethe strategy begins by defining input variables such as take profit and stop loss levels as well as the trading mode long short or bidirectional it then sets a rule to allow only long entries if the trading mode is set to longthe strategy logic is defined using sma simple moving average crossover and crossunder signals it calculates a shortterm sma sma3 and a longerterm sma sma8 and plots them on the chart the crossoversignal and crossundersignal variables are used to track the occurrence of the crossover and crossunder events while the crossoverstate and crossunderstate variables determine the state of the crossover and crossunder conditionsthe strategy execution is based on the current position size if the position size is zero no open positions the strategy checks for crossover and crossunder events if a crossover event occurs and the trading mode allows long entries a long position is entered the entry price stop price take profit price and stop loss price are calculated based on the current close price and the sma8 value similarly if a crossunder event occurs and the trading mode allows short entries a short position is entered with the corresponding price calculationsif there is an existing long position and the current close price reaches either the take profit price or the stop loss price and a crossunder event occurs the long position is closed the entry price stop price take profit price and stop loss price are reset to zerolikewise if there is an existing short position and the current close price reaches either the take profit price or the stop loss price and a crossover event occurs the short position is closed and the price variables are resetthe strategy also plots entry and exit points on the chart using plotshape function it displays a triangle pointing up for a buy entry a triangle pointing down for a buy exit a triangle pointing down for a sell entry and a triangle pointing up for a sell exitoverall the martingale scalping strategy aims to capture small profits by taking advantage of shortterm moving average crossovers and crossunders it incorporates risk management through take profit and stop loss levels and allows for different trading modes to accommodate different market conditions,"{'blackcat1402', 'Moving Averages'}",True,True,True,True,True,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True

trading strategy that capitalizes on the early morning volatility in financial markets its based on the idea that the initial price movements during the first few minutes or hours of the trading day can set the tone for the rest of the session the strategy involves identifying a price range within which the asset trades during the opening period and then taking long positions when the price breaks out to the upside of this rangepivot points are a widely used technical indicator in trading they represent potential support and resistance levels based on the previous days price action pivot points are calculated using the previous days high low and close prices and can help traders identify key price levels for making trading decisionshow to use the scriptinitialization this script is

to capture upside breakoutsit also respects the maximum number of long trades per daythe script manages long positions calculates stop losses and adjusts long positions according to the defined rulestrailing stop mechanismthe script incorporates a dynamic trailing stop mechanism designed to protect and maximize profits for long positions heres how it works1 initializationthe script allows you to choose between two types of initial stop losspercentagebased this option sets the initial stop loss as a percentage of the entry priceprevious days low this option sets the initial stop loss at the previous days low2 setting the initial stop loss sl_long0the initial stop loss sl_long0 is calculated based on the chosen methodif percentage is selected it calculates the stop loss as a percentage of the entry priceif previous low is selected it sets the stop loss at the previous days low3 dynamic trailing stop trail_longthe script then monitors price movements and uses a dynamic trailing stop mechanism trail_long to adjust the stop loss level for long positionsif the current high price rises above certain pivot point levels the trailing stop is adjusted upwards to lock in profitsthe trailing stop levels are calculated based on pivot points r1 r2 r3 etc and halfpivot points r05 r15 r25 etcthe script checks if the high price surpasses these levels and if so updates the trailing stop accordinglythis dynamic trailing stop allows traders to secure profits while giving the position room to potentially capture additional gains4 final stop loss sl_longthe script calculates the final stop loss level sl_long based on the following logicif no position is open pos 0 the stop loss is set to zero indicating there is no active stop lossif a position is open pos 1 the script calculates the maximum of the initial stop loss sl_long0 and the dynamic trailing stop trail_longthis ensures that the stop loss is always set to the more conservative of the two values to protect profits5 plotting the stop lossthe script plots the stop loss level on the chart using the plot functionit will only display the stop loss level if there is an open position pos 1 and its not a new trading day not newdaythe stop loss level is shown in red on the chartby combining an initial stop loss with a dynamic trailing stop based on pivot points and halfpivot points the script aims to provide a comprehensive risk management mechanism for long positions this allows traders to lock in profits as the price moves in their favor while maintaining a safeguard against adverse price movementsend of day eod exitthe script includes an end of day eod exit mechanism to automatically close any open positions at the end of the trading day this feature is designed to manage and control positions when the trading day comes to a close heres how it works1 initializationat the beginning of each trading day the script identifies a new trading day using the is_newbard conditionwhen a new trading day begins the newday variable becomes true indicating the start of a new trading session2 plotting the end of day signalthe script includes a plot on the chart to visually represent the end of day signal this is done using the plot functionthe plot is labeled dayend and is displayed as a comment on the chart it signifies the eod point3 eod exit conditionwhen the script detects that a new trading day has started newday true it triggers the eod exit conditionat this point the script proceeds to close all open positions that may have been active during the trading day4 closing open positionsthe strategyclose_all function is used to close all open positions when the eod exit condition is metthis function ensures that any remaining long positions are exited regardless of their current profit or lossthe function also includes an alert_message which can be customized to send an alert or notification when positions are closed at eodpurpose of eod exitthe end of day exit mechanism serves several essential purposes in the trading strategyrisk management it helps manage risk by ensuring that positions are not left open overnight when markets can experience increased

712,YinYang RSI Volume Trend Strategy,there are many strategies that use rsi or volume but very few that take advantage of how useful and important the two of them combined are this strategy uses the highs and lows with volume and rsi weighted calculations on top of them you may be wondering how much of an impact volume and rsi can have on the prices the answer is a lot and we will discuss those with plenty of examples below but firsthow does this strategy workits simple really when the purchase source crosses above the inner low band red it creates a buy or long this long has a trailing stop loss band the outer low band thats also red that can be adjusted in the settings the stop loss is based on a of the inner low bands price and by default it is 01 lower than the inner bands price this stop loss is not only a stop loss but it can also act as a purchase available locationyou can get back into a trade after a stop loss take profit has been hit when your reset purchase availability after condition has been met this can either be at stop loss entry or none it is advised to allow it to reset in case the stop loss was a fake out but the call was right sometimes it may trigger stop loss multiple times in a row but you dont lose much on stop loss and you gain lots when the call is rightthe take profit location is the basis line white take profit occurs when the exit source close open high low or other crosses the basis line and then on a different bar the exit source crosses back over the basis line for example if it was a long and the bars exit source closed above the basis line and then 2 bars later its exit source closed below the basis line take profit would occur you can disable take profit in settings but it is very useful as many times the price will cross the basis and then correct back rather than making it all the way to the opposing zonelongsif for instance your long doesnt need to take profit and instead reaches the top zone it will close the position when it crosses above the inner top line green please note you can change the exit source too which is what source close open high low it uses to end the tradesthe shorts work the same way as the long but just opposite they start when the purchase source crosses under the inner upper band greenshortsshorts take profit when it crosses under the basis line and then crosses backshorts will stop loss when their outer upper band green is crossed with the exit sourceshort trades are completed and closed when its exit source crosses under the inner low red bandso now that you understand how the strategy works lets discuss why this strategy works and how it is profitablefirst we will discuss volume as we deem it plays a much bigger role overall and in our strategyas im sure many of you know volume plays a huge factor in how much something moves but it also plays a role in the strength of the movement for instance lets look at two scenarios bitcoins price goes up 1000 in 1 day but the volume was only 10 millionbitcoins price goes up 200 in 1 day but the volume was 40 millionif you were to only look at the price youd say 1 was more important because the price moved x5 the amount as 2 but once you factor in the volume you know this is not true the reason why volume plays such a huge role in price movement is because it shows there is a large limit order battle going on it means that both bears and bulls believe that price is a good time to buy and sell this creates a strong support and resistance price point in this location if we look at scenario 2 when there is high volume especially if it is drastically larger than the average volume bitcoin was displaying recently what can we decipher from this well the biggest take away is that the bulls won the battle and that likely when that happens we will see bullish movement continuing to happen as most of the bears limit orders have been fulfilled whereas with 2 when large price movement happens and bitcoin goes up 1000 with low volume what can we deduce the main takeaway is that bulls pressured the price up with market orders where they purchased the best available price also what this means is there were very few people who were wanting to sell this generally dictates that whale limit orders for sellsshorts are much higher up and theres room for movement but it also means there is likely a whale that is ready to dump and crash it back downyou may be wondering what did this example have to do with yinyang rsi volume trend strategy well the reason weve discussed this is because we use volume multiple times to apply multiplications in our calculations to add large weight to the price when there is lots of volume this is applied both positively and negatively for instance if the price drops a little and there is high volume our strategy will move its bounds much lower than the price actually dropped and if there was low volume but the price dropped a lot our strategy will only move its bounds a little we believe this reflects higher levels of price accuracy than just price alone based on the examples described abovedont believe us here is with volume not factored in vwma sma and we remove our volume filter calculationwhich produced 2880 profithere is with our volume factored inwhich produced 553000 553as you can see we went from 2800 profit with volume not factored to 553000 with volume factored thats quite a big difference please note previous success does not predict future success we are simply displaying the amounts as examplenow how about rsi and why does it matter in this strategyas im sure most of you are aware rsi is one of the leading indicators used in trading for this reason we figured it would only make sense to incorporate it into our calculations we fiddled with rsi for quite awhile and sometimes what logically seems to be the right way to use it isnt now because of this our rsi calculation is a little odd but basically what were doing is we calculate the rsi then turn it into a percentage between 01 that can easily be multiplied to the price point we need the price point we use is the difference between our high purchase zone and our low purchase zone this allows us to see how much price movement there is between zones we multiply our zone size with our rsi multiplication and we get the amount we will add to our basis line white line this officially creates the new high and low purchase zones that we are actually using and displaying in our tradesif you found that confusing here are some examples to why it is an important calculation for this strategybefore rsi factored inwhich produced 278 profitafter rsi factored inwhich produced 553 profitas you can see the rsi makes not only the purchase zones more accurate but it also greatly increases the profit the strategy is able to make it also helps ensure an relatively linear profit slope so you know it is reliable with its tradesthis strategy can work on pretty much anything but you should tweak the values a bit for each pair you are trading it with for best resultswe hope you can find some use out of this simple but effective strategy if you have any questions

722,Risk Management and Positionsize - MACD example,mastering risk managementrisk management is the cornerstone of successful trading and its often the difference between turning a profit and suffering a loss in light of its importance i share a risk management tool which you can use for your trading strategies the script not only assists in position sizing but also comes with builtin technical features that help in market timing lets delve into the nittygritty detailsinput parameter marginfactorone of the key features of the script is the marginfactor input parameter this element lets you control the portion of your equity used for placing each trade a marginfactor of 05 means 50 of your total equity will be deployed in placing the position size although tradingview has a builtin option to adjust position sizing in a same way i personally prefer to have the logic in my pinecode script the main reason is userexperience in managing and testing different settings for different charts timeframes and instruments with the same strategy stoploss and marginfactorif your strategy has a 4 stoploss you can choose to use only 50 of your equity by setting the marginfactor to 05 in this case you are effectively risking only 2 of your total capital per trade which aligns well with the widelyaccepted rule of thumb suggesting a 12 risk per trade similar if your stoploss is only 1 you can choose to change the marginfactor to 1 resulting in a positionsize of 200 of your equity the total risk would be again 2 per trade if your stoploss is set to 1max drawdown and marginfactoryour marginfactor setting can also be aligned with the maximum drawdown of your strategy seen during a backtested period of 23 years for example if the max drawdown is 15 you could calibrate your marginfactor accordingly to limit your risk exposureoption to toggle number of contractsthe script offers the option to toggle between using a percentage of equity for position sizing or specifying a fixed number of contracts utilizing a percentage of equity might yield unrealistic backtest results especially over longer periods this occurs because as the capital grows the absolute position size also increases potentially inflating the accumulated returns generated by the backtester on the other hand setting a fixed number of contracts as your position size offers a more stable and realistic roi over the backtested period as it removes the compounding effect on position sizeskey features strategymacd high time frame entry and exit logicthe strategy employs a high time frame macd moving average convergence divergence to make entry and exit decisions you can easily adjust the timeframe settings and macd settings in the inputsection to trade on lower timeframes for more

740,Liquidity Breakout - Strategy [presentTrading],introduction and how it is differentthe liquidity breakout strategy is a unique trading strategy that focuses on identifying and leveraging patterns in market price data this strategy mainly inspired by the script master pattern by luxalgo takes a different approach from many traditional strategies that rely on technical indicators or fundamental analysis instead the liquidity breakout is based on the concept of contraction detection and liquidity levels this approach allows traders to identify potential trading opportunities that other strategies might missbtcusdt 6h the strategy is different from other trading strategies because it uses a unique combination of pattern detection liquidity levels and userdefined trading direction this combination allows the strategy to adapt to various market conditions and trading styles making it a versatile tool for traders strategy how it works1 contraction detection the strategy uses a lookback period defined by the user default is 10 bars to identify contractions in the market a contraction is a period where the market is consolidating often followed by a significant price movement the strategy identifies contractions by finding pivot highs and pivot lows within the lookback period if a pivot high is lower than the previous pivot high and a pivot low is higher than the previous pivot low a contraction is detected2 liquidity levels what are liquidity levels liquidity levels also known as liquidity pools or zones are price levels at which there is a significant amount of trading activity they are often areas where large institutional traders like banks or hedge funds have placed orders these levels are important because they can act as support or resistance levels and price often reacts at these levelsin the context of this strategy liquidity levels are used to identify potential entry and exit points for trades when the price reaches a liquidity level it could indicate a potential trading opportunity for example if the price breaks through a liquidity level it could signal the start of a new trend on the other hand if the price approaches a liquidity level and then reverses it could signal a potential reversalthe strategy uses these two elements to identify potential trading opportunities when a contraction is detected the strategy will look for a breakout in the direction of the trend if the breakout occurs at a liquidity level the strategy will execute a tradethe strategy also allows traders to set their stop loss based on either the average true range atr or a fixed percentage this flexibility allows traders to manage their risk according to their personal risk tolerance and trading style trade directionone of the unique features of the master pattern strategy is the ability to choose the trading direction traders can choose to trade in the long direction the short direction or both this feature allows traders to adapt the strategy to their personal trading style and market outlookfor example if a trader believes that the market is in an uptrend they can choose to trade only in the long direction conversely if the market is in a downtrend they can choose to trade only in the short direction if the trader believes that the market is volatile and there are opportunities in both directions they can choose to trade in both directions usageto use the strategy traders need to input their preferred settings including the contraction detection lookback period liquidity levels stop loss type and trading direction once these settings are input the strategy will automatically detect potential trading opportunities and execute trades according to the defined parameters default settingsthe default settings for the master pattern strategy are as followscontraction detection lookback 10liquidity levels 20stop loss type atratr length 20atr multiplier 30fixed percentage 001trading direction boththese settings can be adjusted according to the traders personal preferences and market conditions its recommended that traders experiment with different settings to find the ones that work best for their trading style and goals,"{'breakouttrading', 'liquidity', 'strategy', 'Pivot points and levels', 'presenttrading', 'Average True Range (ATR)', 'tradinstrategy'}",False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

involves several inputs and conditions before using it in live trading it is highly recommended to thoroughly test it on historical data and use risk management techniques to safeguard your capital after backtesting its also highly recommended to perform a first live test with a small amount additionally its essential to have a good understanding of the strategys behavior and potential risks only risk what you can afford to loseused indicators1 commodity channel index ccithe commodity channel index cci is a technical analysis indicator used to measure the momentum of an asset it was developed by donald lambert and first published in commodities magazine now futures in 1980 despite its name the cci can be used in any market and is not just for commodities the cci compares current price to average price over a specific time period the indicator fluctuates above or below zero moving into positive or negative territory while most values approximately 75 fall between 100 and 100 about 25 of the values fall outside this range indicating a lot of weakness or strength in the price movementthe cci was originally developed to spot longterm trend changes but has been adapted by traders for use on all markets or timeframes trading with multiple timeframes provides more buy or sell signals for active traders traders often use the cci on the longerterm chart to establish the dominant trend and on the shorterterm chart to isolate pullbacks and generate trade signalscci is calculated with the following formulapine scripttypical price simple moving average 0015 x mean deviationsome trading strategies based on cci can produce multiple false signals or losing trades when conditions turn choppy implementing a stoploss strategy can help cap risk and testing the cci strategy for profitability on your market and timeframe is a worthy first step before initiating trades2 average true range atrthe average true range atr is a technical analysis indicator that measures market volatility by calculating the average range of price movements in a financial asset over a specific period of time the atr was developed by j welles wilder jr and introduced in his book new concepts in technical trading systems in 1978the atr is calculated by taking the average of the true range over a specified period the true range is the greatest of the followingthe difference between the current high and the current lowthe difference between the previous close and the current highthe difference between the previous close and the current lowthe atr can be used to set stoploss orders one way to use atr for stoploss orders is to multiply the atr by a factor such as 2 or 3 and subtract it from the entry price for long positions or add it to the entry price for short positions this can help traders set stoploss orders that are more adaptive to market volatility3 exponential moving average emathe exponential moving average ema is a type of moving average ma

770,Powertrend - Volume Range Filter Strategy [wbburgin],the powertrend is a range filter that is based off of volume instead of price this helps the range filter capture trends more accurately than a pricebased range filter because the range filter will update itself from changes in volume instead of changes in price in certain scenarios this means that the powertrend will be more profitable than a normal range filteressentials of the strategythis is a breakout strategy which works best on trending assets with high volume and liquidity it should be used on middle to higher timeframes and can be used on all assets that have volume provided by the data source stocks crypto forex it is longonly as of now it can work on lower timeframes if you optimize the strategy filters to make less trades or if your exchangebroker is lowno fees provided that your exchangebroker has high liquidity and volumethe strategy enters a long position if the range filter is trending upwards and the price crosses over the upper range band which signifies a pricevolume breakout the strategy closes the long position if the range filter is trending downwards and the price crosses under the lower range band which signifies a breakdown both these conditions can be altered by the three filter options in the settings the default trend filter is not alterable because it helps prevent false entries and exits that are against the trendsettingsthe length setting is the lookback period for the range smoothingthe adx filter setting enables you to turn on an adx filter which will halt entries and exits unless the adx of your customizable length is above a adx vwma of that lengththe range supertrend setting creates a supertrend from the top and bottom ranges which can be used to filter entries and exits the length is customizable the filter can show you whether the range is making higher highs and lower lows below is an example of the range supertrend being used as a filter and plotted oncharthttpswwwtradingviewcomxz2w2ksguthe vwma setting halts entries if they are below a customizable length vwmaboth the range supertrend and the vwma can also be plotted separately without actually filtering the strategy so that you can use them independently if you wish you can turn off the bar color the highlighting and the labels if you wish in the settings a note about the bar color if the color changes but the strategy does not signal an exit or entry this means that the crossover was against the trend in these circumstances it may be indicative of a pullback to enter or exit or to add onto your positionabout the strategy results belowa range filter is normally composed of two components the range filter itself and a smoothing function in the development of this script i tested both normal and volumebased varieties of the range filter and the smoothing functiontests performedvolumebased range x vwma smoothingpricebased range x vwma smoothingpricebased range x ema smoothingvolumebased range x ema smoothing final resultthe highestperforming was a volumebased range filter and a normal emabased smoothing function but that does not mean that this strategy will be profitable exits are based off of signal reversion so i strongly encourage you to develop your own take profitsstop losses for the strategy if you think it may be a good fit for you the results below are with a commission value of 005 because i built the strategy first for equities slippage of 3 so if your exchangebroker has a higher fee schedule i recommend adding filters andor moving to higher timeframes for the strategy additionally i used 10 of equity in each trade while using the range supertrend filter the previous upload was unrealistic because it used 100 of equity missed a 0 apologies and added in slippage,"{'trendtrading', 'strategy', 'Volume', 'rangefilter', 'Trend Analysis', 'volumeanalysis', 'Bands and Channels'}",True,False,True,True,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

796,Range Breaker,strategy description range breakerthe range breaker strategy is a breakout trading strategy that aims to capture profits when the price of a financial instrument moves out of a defined range the strategy identifies swing highs and swing lows over a specified lookback period and enters long or short positions when the price breaks above the swing high or below the swing low respectively it also employs stop targets based on a percentage to manage risk and protect profitsbeginners guideunderstand the conceptsa swing high a swing high is a local peak in price where the price is higher than the surrounding pricesb swing low a swing low is a local trough in price where the price is lower than the surrounding pricesc lookback period the number of bars or periods the strategy analyzes to determine swing highs and swing lowsd stop target a predetermined price level at which the strategy will exit the position to manage risk and protect profitsconfigure the

manage riskb dont risk more than a small percentage of your trading capital on a single tradec be prepared to adjust the strategy or stop trading it if the market conditions change significantlyadjusting the lookback period and timeframes for optimal strategy performancethe range breaker strategy uses a lookback period to identify swing highs and lows which serve as the basis for determining entry and exit points for long and short positions by adjusting the lookback period and analyzing different timeframes you can potentially find the best strategy configuration for each specific assetadjusting the lookback periodthe lookback period is a critical parameter that affects the sensitivity of the strategy to price movements a shorter lookback period will make the strategy more sensitive to smaller price fluctuations resulting in more frequent trading signals on the other hand a longer lookback period will make the strategy less sensitive generating fewer signals but potentially capturing larger price movementsto optimize the lookback period for a specific asset you can test different lookback values and compare their performance in terms of riskadjusted returns win rate and other relevant metrics keep in mind that using an overly short lookback period may lead to overtrading and increased transaction costs while an overly long lookback period may cause the strategy to miss profitable trading opportunitiesanalyzing different timeframestimeframes refer to the duration of each bar or candlestick on the chart shorter timeframes eg 5minute 15minute or 30minute focus on intraday price movements while longer timeframes eg daily weekly or monthly capture longerterm trends the choice of timeframe affects the number of trading signals generated by the strategy and the length of time each position is heldto find the best strategy for each asset you can test the range breaker strategy on different timeframes and analyze its performance keep in mind that shorter timeframes may require more active monitoring and management due to the increased frequency of trading signals longer timeframes on the other hand may require more patience as positions are held for extended periodsfinding the best strategy for each assetevery asset has unique price characteristics that may affect the performance of a trading strategy to find the best strategy for each asset you shoulda test various lookback periods and timeframes observing the strategys performance in terms of profitability riskadjusted returns and win rateb consider the assets historical

look no further our algorithmic trading strategy flash is here to simplify your trading process and maximize your profitsflash is an advanced trading algorithm that combines three powerful indicators to generate highly selective and accurate trading signals the momentumrsi supertrend analysis and emastrategy indicators are used to identify the strength and direction of the underlying trendthe momentumrsi signals the strength of the trend and only generates trading signals in confirmed upward or downward trends the supertrend analysis confirms the trend direction and generates signals when the price breaks through the supertrend line the emastrategy is used as a qualifier for the generation of trading signals where buy signals are generated when the ema crosses relevant trend linesflash is highly selective as it only generates trading signals when all three indicators align this ensures that only the highest probability trades are taken resulting in maximum profitsour trading strategy also comes with two profit management options option 1 uses the socalled supertrendindicator which uses the dynamic atr as a key input while option 2 applies predefined fixed sl and tp levelsthe settings for each indicator can be customized allowing you to adjust the length limit value factor and source value to suit your preferences you can also set the time period in which you

jstechtrading cudos to baby_whale_to_moon for doing a great job in transforming sophisticated trading ideas into pine scriptsdetailed descriptionthe flash script considers the following indicators for the generation of trading signals1 momentumrsi2 supertrendanalysis3 emastrategy1 momentumrsi this indicator signals the strength of the underlying upward or downwardtrend the signal range of this indicator is from 0 to 100 values 60 indicate a confirmed upward or downwardtrend the strategy will only generate trading signals in case the stock or any other financial security is in a confirmed upward long entry signals or downwardtrend short entry signals this indicator provides information with regards to the strength of the underlying trend and it does not give any insight with regard to the direction of the trend therefore this strategy also considers other indicators which provide technical confirmation with regards to the direction of the underlying trendgraph 1 shows this concept the momentumrsi indicator gives lower readings during consolidation phases and no trading signals are generated during these periodsexample graph 2 2 supertrend analysis the red line in the graph below represents the socalled supertrendline trading signals are only generated in case the price action breaks through this supertrendline indicating a new confirmed upwardtrend or downwardtrend respectively if that happens the super trendline changes its color from red to green giving confirmation that the trend changed from bearish to bullish and longentries can be considered the viceversa approach can be considered for short entriesgraph 3 explains this concept3 exponential moving average emastrategythe functionality of this emaelement of the strategy has been programmed as follows the exponential moving average and two other trend lines are being used as qualifiers for the generation of tradingsignals buysignals for longentries are only considered in case the ema yellow line in the graph below crosses the red line sellsignals for shortentries are only considered in case the ema yellow line in the graph below crosses the green linean example is shown in graph 4 below we use this indicator to determine the new trend direction that may occur by using the data of the prices past movement4 bringing it all togetherthis section describes in detail how this strategy combines the momentumrsi the supertrend analysis and the emastrategythe strategy only generates tradingsignals in case all of the following conditions and qualifiers are being met1 momentumrsi is higher than the set value of this strategy the standard and recommended value is 60 graph 5 2 the supertrend analysis needs to indicate a confirmed upwardtrend for longentry signals or a confirmed downwardtrend for shortentry signals respectively3 the emastrategy needs to indicate that the stock or financial security is in a confirmed upwardtrend longentries or downwardtrend shortentries respectivelythe strategy will only generate trading signals if all three qualifiers are being met this makes this strategy highly selective and is the key secret for its successexample for longentry graph 6 when these conditions are met our long position is openedexample for shortentry graph 7trade management options graph 8option 1 in this dynamic version the socalled supertrendindicator is being used for the trade exit management this supertrendindicator is a sophisticated and optimized methodology which uses the dynamic atr as one of its key input parametersthe following settings of the supertrendindicator can be changed and optimized graph 9the dynamic sltplines of the supertrendindicator are shown in the charts the atrlength and the supertrendfactor result in a multiplier value

for 1 hourcharts however the underlying principles of this strategy are supply and demand in the financial markets and the strategy can be applied to all timeframes daytraders can use the 1min or 5min charts swingtraders can use the daily charts this strategy has been designed to identify the most promising highest probability entries and trades for each stock or other financial security the combination of the qualifiers results in a highly selective strategy which only considers the most promising swingtrading entries as a result you will normally only find a low number of trades for each stock or other financial security per year in case you apply this strategy for the daily charts shorter timeframes will result in a higher number of trades year consequently traders need to apply

844,Advanced VWAP_Pullback Strategy_Trend-Template Qualifier,general description and unique features of this scriptintroducing the advanced vwap momentumpullback strategy longonly that offers several unique features1 our scriptstrategy utilizes mark minervinis trendtemplate as a qualifier for identifying stocks and other financial securities in confirmed uptrends mark minervini a 2x us investment champion developed the trendtemplate which covers eight different and independent characteristics that can be adjusted and optimized in this trendfollowing strategy to ensure the best results the strategy will only trigger buysignals in case the optimized qualifiers are being met2 our strategy is based on the supplydemand balance in the market making it timeless and effective across all timeframes whether you are day trading using 1 or 5min charts or swingtrading using daily charts this strategy can be applied and works very well3 we have also integrated technical indicators such as the rsi and the ma vwap crossover into this strategy to identify lowrisk pullback entries in the context of confirmed uptrends by doing so the risk profile of this strategy and drawdowns are being reduced to an absolute minimumminervinis trendtemplate and the stageanalysis of the marketsthis strategy is a socalled longonly strategy this means that we only take long positions short positions are not considered the best market environment for such strategies are periods of stable upward trends in the socalled stage 2 uptrend in stable upward trends we increase our market exposure and risk in sideways markets and downward trends or bear markets we reduce our exposure very quickly or go 100 to cash and wait for the markets to recover and improve this allows us to avoid major losses and drawdowns this simple rule gives us a significant advantage over most undisciplined traders and amateurs the trend is your friend this is a very old but true quotewhats behind it 98 of stocks made their biggest gains in a phase 2 upward trend if a stock is in a stable uptrend this is evidence that larger institutions are buying the stock sustainably by focusing on stocks that are in a stable uptrend the chances of profit are significantly increased in a stable uptrend investors know exactly what to expect from further price developments this makes it possible to locate lowrisk entry points the goal is not to buy at the lowest price the goal is to buy at the right priceeach stock goes through the same maturity cycle it starts at stage 1 and ends at stage 4 stage 1 neglect phase consolidationstage 2 progressive phase accumulationstage 3 topping phase distributionstage 4 downtrend capitulationthis strategy focuses on identifying stocks in confirmed stage 2 uptrends this in itself gives us an advantage over longterm investors and less professional tradersby focusing on stocks in a stage 2 uptrend we avoid losses in downtrends stage 4 or less profitable consolidation phases stages 1 and 3 we are fully invested and put our money to work for us and we are fully invested when stocks are in their stage 2 uptrendsbut how can we use technical chart analysis to find stocks that are in a stable stage 2 uptrendmark minervini has developed the socalled trend template for this purpose this is an essential part of our jstechtrading pullback strategy for our watchlists only those individual values that meet the tough requirements of minervinis trend template are eligiblethe trend template 200d ma increasing over a period of at least 1 month better 45 months or longer 150d ma above 200d ma 50d ma above 150d ma and 200d ma course above 50d ma 150d ma and 200d ma ideally the 50d ma is increasing over at least 1 month price at least 25 above the 52w low price within 25 of 52w high high relative strength according to ibd note in this basic version of the script the trendtemplate has to be used as a separate indicator on tradingview public trendtemplate indicators are available in tradingview community scripts it is recommended to only execute buy signals in case the stock or financial security is in a stage 2 uptrend which means that the criteria of the trendtemplate are fulfilledthis strategy can be applied to all timeframes from 5 min to dailythe vwap momentumpullback strategyfor the jstechtrading vwap momentumpullback strategy only stocks and other financial instruments that meet the selected criteria of mark minervinis trend template are recommended for algorithmic trading with this startegya further prerequisite for generating a buy signals is that the individual value is in a shortterm oversold state rsi when the selling pressure is over and the continuation of the uptrend can be confirmed by the ma vwap crossover after reaching a price low a buy signal is issued by this strategystoploss limits and profit targets can be set variably you also have the option to make use of the trailing stop exit strategyrelative strength index rsithe relative strength index rsi is a technical indicator developed by welles wilder in 1978 the rsi is used to perform a market value analysis and identify the strength of a trend as well as overbought and oversold conditions the indicator is calculated on a scale from 0 to 100 and shows how much an asset has risen or fallen relative to its own price in recent periodsthe rsi is calculated as the ratio of average profits to average losses over a certain period of time a high value of the rsi indicates an overbought situation while a low value indicates an oversold situation typically a value 70 is considered an overbought threshold and a value 30 is considered an oversold threshold a value above 70 signals that a single value may be overvalued and a decrease in price is likely while a value below 30 signals that a single value may be undervalued and an increase in price is likelyfor example lets say youre watching a stock xyz after a prolonged falling movement the rsi value of this stock has fallen to 26 this means that the stock is oversold and that it is time for a potential recovery therefore a trader might decide to buy this stock in the hope that it will rise again soonthe ma vwap crossover trading strategythis strategy combines two popular technical indicators the moving average ma and the volume weighted average price vwap the ma vwap crossover strategy is used to identify potential trend reversals and entryexit points in the marketthe vwap is calculated by taking the average price of an asset for a given period weighted by the volume traded at each price level the ma on the other hand is calculated by taking the average price of an asset over a specified number of periods when the ma crosses above the vwap it suggests that buying pressure is increasing and it may be a good time to enter a long position when the ma crosses below the vwap it suggests that selling pressure is increasing and it may be a good time to exit a long position or enter a short positiontraders typically use the ma vwap crossover strategy in conjunction with other technical indicators and fundamental analysis to make more informed trading decisions as with any trading strategy it is important to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before making any tradesthis strategy is applicable to all timeframes and the relevant parameters for the underlying indicators rsi and mavwap can be adjusted and optimized as needed backtestingbacktesting gives outstanding results on all timeframes and drawdowns can be reduced to a minimum level in this example the hourly chart for mcft has been usedsettings for backtesting are period from jan 2020 until march 2023 starting capital 100k usd position size 25 of equity 001 commission usd 250 per trade slippage 2 ticksother comments this strategy has been designed to identify the most promising highest probability entries and trades for each stock or other financial security the combination of the trendtemplate and the rsi qualifiers results in a highly selective strategy which only considers the most promising swingtrading entries as a result you will normally only find a low number of trades for each stock or other financial security per year in case you apply this strategy for the daily charts shorter timeframes will result in a higher number of trades year consequently traders need to apply this strategy for a full watchlist rather than just one financial security,"{'pullback', 'Moving Averages', 'vwapbreakout', 'js-techtrading', 'rsi_overbought', 'Volume Weighted Moving Average

loss is 3900 you calculate the distance in percent between 4000 and 3900 in this case that distance would be of 250 then you calculate your position by this way initial or current capital risk per

you can find an option called use leverage activate this if you want to backtest using leverage which means that in case of not having enough money for risking the determined by you of your account using your initial capital you will use leverage for using the enough amount for risking that of your acount in a buy position otherwise the amount will be limited by your initialcurrent capitalsome

879,Rocket Grid Algorithm - The Quant Science,the rocket grid algorithm is a trading strategy that enables traders to engage in both long and short selling strategies the script allows traders to backtest their strategies with a date range of their choice in addition to selecting the desired strategy either sma based crossunder or sma based crossoverthe script is a combination of trend following and shortterm mean reversing strategies trend following involves identifying the current market trend and riding it for as long as possible until it changes direction this type of strategy can be used over a medium to longterm time horizon typically several months to a few yearsshortterm mean reversing on the other hand involves taking advantage of shortterm price movements that deviate from the average price this type of strategy is usually applied over a much shorter time horizon such as a few days to a few weeks by rapidly entering and exiting positions the strategy seeks to capture small quick gains in volatile market conditionsoverall the script blends the best of both worlds by combining the longterm stability of trend following with the quick gains of shortterm mean reversing allowing traders to potentially benefit from both shortterm and longterm market trendstraders can configure the start and end dates months and years and choose the length of the data they want to work with additionally they can set the percentage grid and the upper and lower destroyers to manage their trades effectively the script also calculates the simple moving average of the chosen data length and plots it on the chartthe trigger for entering a trade is defined as a crossunder or crossover of the close price with the simple moving average once the trigger is activated the script calculates the total percentage of the side and creates a grid range the grid range is then divided into ten equal parts with each part representing a unique grid level the script keeps track of each grid level and once the close price reaches the grid level it opens a trade in the specified directionthe equity management strategy in the script involves a dynamic allocation of equity to each trade the first order placed uses 10 of the available equity while each subsequent order uses 1 less of the available equity this results in the allocation of 9 for the second order 8 for the third order and so on until a maximum of 10 open trades this approach allows for risk management and can help to limit potential lossesoverall the rocket grid algorithm is a flexible and powerful trading strategy that can be customized to meet the specific needs of individual traders its userfriendly interface and robust backtesting capabilities make it an excellent tool for traders looking to enhance their trading experience,"{'strategy', 'Pine utilities', 'stocktrading', 'backtesting', 'cryptotrading', 'quant', 'gridtrading', 'meanreverting', 'trendfollowing', 'gridbots'}",False,True,True,True,False,True,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,False,True,True

direction of breakoutbreakdownthere are plenty of ways level can be determined levels are the decision point to take a trade or not but if we make the level derivation complex then the execution may get hamper this strategy script developed in pinescript v5 is our attempt at solving this problem at the core by providing this simple yet elegant solution to this problemits essentially an attempt to trade simple by drawing logical horizontal lines in the chart and take actions after multiple associated parameters confirmation on the breakout breakdown of the levelshowlet us explain how we are drawing the levels we are depending on some of the parameters as described belowopen range during intraday movement often if prices move beyond a particular level it exibits more movement in the same swing in same direction we found out through our back testing for indian indices like nifty banknifty or cnxfinance the first 15m ie 0915 am to 0930 am ist is one of such range for indian stocks it is 915 to 945 and for mcx crudeoil1 its 500 pm to 600 pm there are our first levelspdhcl previous day high close low this is our next levelvwap the rolling vwap volume weighted average pricein the breakoutbreakdown of the open range and previous day highlow we are taking the trade decisions as follows using cest principleconditions if current bars say you are in 5m timeframe closing is broken out the open range high or previous day high taken a buylong decision lets say buying a call option ce or selling a put option pe or buying the future or cash if current bars say you are in 5m timeframe closing is broken down the open range low or previous day low taken a sellshort decision lets say buying a put option ce or selling a call option pe or selling the future or cash additionally and optionally default on one can turn off we are checking various other associated multiple confirmations as follows 1 momentum checking 14period rsi value is more than 50 or less than 50 all parameters like period ob os ranges are configurable through settings 2 current bars volume is more than the last 20 bars volume average how much more that multiplier is also configurable default is 1 3 the breakout candle is bullish green or bearish redentry all of these happens only on the closing of the candle means non repainting clearly in the chart we are showing as green up arrow bo breakout for buy and red down arrow bd breakdown for sell to take your decision process smooth so on the closing of the decision bobd candle we are entering the trade with a thumping heart and nail biting stop loss we are relying on the time tasted last 40 years mechanism of average true range atr of default 14 period this default period is also configurable so for long trades the 14 period atr low band is the sl for short trades the 14 period atr high band is the sltarget we are depending on the thump rule of 12 risk reward its simple and effective no fancy thing we are closing the trade on double the favorable price movement compared to the sl placed of course this rr ratio is confiurable from the settings as usual whats unqiue in itthe utter simplicity of this trading mechanism no fancy things like complex chart pattern oi data multiple candlestick patterns order flow analysis etc simple level determination marking clearly in the chart making each parameter configurable in settings and showing tooltip adjacent to the parameter to make you understand it better for your customization wait for the candle close thus eliminating the chances of repainting

917,VWMA/SMA 3Commas Bot,this strategy utilizes two pairs of different moving averages two volumeweighted moving averages vwma and two simple moving averages smathere is a fast and slow version of each vwma and sma the concept behind this strategy is that volume is not taken into account when calculating a simple moving average simple moving averages are often used to determine the dominant direction of price movement and to help a trader look past any shortterm volatility or noise from price movement and instead determine the overall direction of price movement so that one can trade in that direction trendfollowing or look for opportunities to trade against that direction fadingby comparing the different movements of a volumeweighted moving average against a simple moving average of the same length a trader can get a better picture of what price movements are actually significant helping to reduce false signals that might occur from only using simple moving averagesthe practical applications of this strategy are identifying dominant directional trends these can be found when the volume weighted moving average is moving in the same direction as the simple moving average and ideally tracking above it this would indicate that there is sufficient volume supporting an uptrend or downtrend and thus gives traders additional confirmation to potentially look for a trade in that directionone can initially look for the fast vwma to track above the fast sma as your initial sign of bullish confirmation reversed for downtrending markets then when the fast vwma crosses over the slow sma one can determine additional trend strength finally when the slow vwma crosses over the slow sma one can determine that the trend is truly strongtraders can choose to look for trade entries at either of those triggers depending on risk tolerance and risk appetitefurthermore this strategy can be used to identify divergence or weakness in trending movements this is very helpful for identifying potential areas to exit ones trade or even look for countertrend trades reversalsthese moments occur when the volumeweighted moving average either fast or slow begins to trade in the opposite direction as their simple moving average counterpart for instance if price has been trending upwards for awhile and the fast vwma begins to trade underneath the fast sma this is an indication that volume is beginning to falter uptrends need appropriate volume to continue moving with momentum so when we see volume begin to falter it can be a potential sign of an upcoming reversal in trenddepending on how quickly one wants to enter into a movement one could look for crosses of the fast vwma underover the fast sma crosses of the fast vwma overunder the slow sma or crosses overunder of the slow vwma and the slow smathis concept was originally published here on tradingview by profitprogrammershere is a link to his original indicator script i have added onto this concept byconverting the original indicator into a strategy tester for backtestingadding the ability to conveniently test long or short strategies or bothadding the ability to calculate dynamic position sizesadding the ability to calculate dynamic stop losses and take profit levels using the average true rangeadding the ability to exit trades based on overboughtoversold crosses of the stochastic rsiconveniently switch between different thresholds or speeds of the moving average crosses to test different strategies on different asset classeseasily hook this strategy up to 3commas for automation via their dca bot featurefull credit to profitprogrammers for the original concept and ideaany feedback or suggestions are greatly appreciated,"{'Simple Moving Average (SMA)', 'Bitcoin (Cryptocurrency)', 'ETH', 'movingaveragecrossover', 'moving_average', 'Cryptocurrency', 'crypto', 'Volume Weighted Moving Average (VWMA)'}",False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True

930,Cipher_B (Finandy support),in this version of the script you can force to cancel your position after some amount of time indepedently on price action for example your bot open a short position with sl1 and tp24 but price did not reach any of this level over the course of to say 8 hours in this case position will be closed regardless of the priceother interesting features are volume and slope filters slope is essentially a derivative of price action if you dont like to buy your instrument under high volatility for example if a trend goes down too fast then you can filter long position which could be opened according to the strategy same thing for volume filter if the volume is too hightoo low you might want to escape such setup in your trading strategymoreover you can tune price shift for opening position to say if you believe that the signal for opening position comes too early everytime you can force the strategy to buy at 1 lower price than the current price when the signal comes similar logic for short open position price will be always higher than the price of the signal if the price did not reach such level then position will be automatically cancel with a new signal arrival check the backtesting results to understand better the logic,"{'Candlestick analysis', 'Trend Analysis', 'cipherb'}",False,False,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False

952,Sine Wave Theory,there are some ideas out there that the market is like a collection of quantum events and that it could all be broken down into sine waves i created this script to put that to the testthe idea is simple i tested 3 different factors that could be put into sine wave form1 bar change2 volume average change3 coin flipfor the bar change i simply allow the sine wave to move upwards or downwards if the bars have changed color in their sequence for example if there were 3 red bars and 1 green bar it would not move the sine wave up or down until the green bar appearedfor the average volume change it was the same idea except that the sine wave could only move up or down if the volume had moved up or below the average value of the length given for calculating the average volumefinally the coin flip simply simulates flipping a coin and allows the sine wave to move one direction or the other once it has a side that is different from the previous chosen side for example heads heads heads tails once it flipped to tails this would allow it to move a directionthe sine wave trading theory that i watched claimed that if you know the correct sine wave which is how large the peak is andor the sine wave count which is how many peaks and valleys occur that you can successfully predict future trades their claims that the reason it does not look like a perfect sine wave for these events is because there is different amounts of trading going on thus the timing will be slightly offi am posting this to disagree with their ideas for example if you select to turn on trading for coin flip and turn off bar change you will see the coin flip did better on the default settingsit just so happens that any setting will eventually be good making all the sine wave variations just completely random if you win or noti posted this to demonstrate how silly trading sine waves is the real trick is using cosine and tangent waves lol jki hope this helps someone avoid this scam concept,"{'Volume', 'Candlestick analysis', 'sine', 'Oscillators', 'sinecycle', 'sinewaves'}",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False
953,3Commas Bot DCA Backtester & Signals FREE,this is a dca strategy backtester signals built to emulate the 3commas dca bots it uses your choice of 4 different buy signals 2 of which can be adjusted in the settings everything is customizable so you can backtest specific settings with different buy signals and find the best performing strategy for your risk tolerance and capital it can be used to backtest strategies on stocks as well but just make sure your base order is larger than the share price for the entire backtesting range or it will not calculate properlyyou can use this template to code your own buy signals and then backtest them as a dca strategy if you know some basic pine scriptthe indicator shows all of your backtesting orders on the chart the red line is your take profit level the blue line is your average price level the white line is your first order and the green lines are your average down orders if you enable a stop loss in the settings your stop loss will be shown as an orange line once all of your average down orders have been hit it will not be set until price has dipped below your covered trading rangethese levels update when things change during backtesting so you can visualize your strategy and how it would perform as well as see if your percentage deviation is large enough to cover dips when backtesting trades are taken the chart will show where they were takenin backtesting along with info on those trades such as the number each order is the size of that order and the percentage deviation that order is from the initial buysending signals to 3commastradingview cannot sync this backtester to 3commas and with the way alerts are setup for strategies on tradingview the best option for you to give signals to your bot would be to use this backtester to figure out what trigger you want to use and then setup that indicator separately to send alerts to your bot all of the indicators used for signals in this backtester are available for free and can be configured to match this backtester and send alerts to 3commas for you just make sure you set your alerts to once per bar close and dont use less than a 15 second timeframe because then you could trigger the tradingview threshold for alerts and get your alerts shut offyou can also use this backtester with your own buy triggers if you know a little pine script just make copy of the script and code in your own buy signals and see how it backtestsinfo panel for analyzing your strategythe right hand side of the screen will show an info panel that shows a lot of different information so you can quickly see your bot settings and how it performed right on the screenin the top right corner you will see in purple your bot settings these include your stoploss if turned on

options to find the perfect strategystoploss onoffthis will turn your stoploss on or off by default it is set to off and will not affect anything unless turned onstoploss percentagethis is the percentage below your final average down order price that will be set as a stoploss to keep your account from going too far in the red on big dipstake profit percentage this is the percentage of profit you want the trade to hit before taking profit on your entire dca trade this level updates everytime you average downaverage down percentage this is the percentage that price has to drop from your initial order to initiate your first safety order if the average down percent multiplier is set to 1 then this percentage will be the same for every average down orderaverage down percentage multiplier this multiplies your average down percentage so each safety order needs a larger percentage deviation than the previous one this keeps your buys closer together at the beginning and further apart when you hit more orders so you can extend your trading range but still be aggressive when price is going sidewaysvolume multiplier per new order this multiplies the size of each trade based on your base order if you set it to a 2x multiplier then each average down order will be 2 times the size of the last one so for example a 100 base order with a 2x multiplier would have these values for the first 3 average down orders 200 400 800size of base order this is the size of your first position entry and will be used as a starting point for the volume multiplier if your base order is 100 then it will buy 100 worth of whatever crypto you are backtesting this on if you are looking at stock charts you need to make sure your base order is higher than the share price across the entire backtesting range or it will not perform correctlymax number of orders this is the maximum number of orders the bot can take including your base order adjust this to suit the amount of capital you are willing to allocate to your bot based on how much money it will require to run according to your bot settingstips on how to use for best resultsif you dont have a lot of capital to work with then use longer timeframes with a reasonable take profit percentage so that you dont need a lot of average down orders you can also try keeping the volume multiplier close to 1you can use the 3commas dca bot settings page to see how much capital you will need for your strategy if you match it to the settings you have on this indicator you can also check to see how much of a percentage deviation your bot is covering to make sure you have a reasonable range to trade in and orders to cover big dips you can also check your coverage by seeing how far down the chart the green lines cover which are your average down ordersmake sure the initial capital in the properties tab of the settings has enough to cover all of your orders otherwise you will get unrealistic backtesting results also make sure you leave the order size in the properties tab on contracts so it calculates your trades correctly the only settings you need to touch in the properties tab is the initial capital unless you are trading somewhere that has lower commission fees then you can change that to match but leave all the other settings as is for it to function properlyincreasing the volume multiplier will make your average price and take profit target follow the price action a lot closer as price falls but it can also lead to having very large orders very quickly once you get into the 153x multiple range try using a high volume multiplier with less safety orders and you will get better results however you need to have money on the sidelines to add on major dips to keep your bot turning a profit be very careful with this as greed and impatience will hurt your overall performance this bot is meant to make money with lots of small wins so dont get greedy and make sure you have enough money to cover large dips if you are being aggressive with your bot then i recommend only using 25 or less of your portfolio to trade aggressively and then use the smart trade feature on 3commas to add chunks of funds to your trades when price dips below your last safety order or if you want it to run without any supervision then use lower volume multipliers and have lots of safety orders that can cover entire bear markets and still keep buying lowerits a good idea to have some capital on the sidelines that you can add in when price dips quickly this will help lower your average price and allow your bot to get out in profit quicker 3commas bot has a smart trade feature that will allow you to track your average price when adding extra funds and it will automatically update your other orders which is very convenient look at the longer timeframes when price dips and only add chunks at major areas where price is very likely to bounce or you can be aggressive when trading and add to your position when price dips and is at a likely bounce zone to maximize profitsonly trade coins that have a good amount of liquidity as the larger your orders get the harder it will be to sell if there isnt much liquidity also beware of how large your first order is as it will usually be a market order and can move the market if there is not much liquiditysince this bot takes a lot of trades and performs best when taking small profits consistently you will need to factor in exchange fees the bot is set to 5 commissionyou can change this on the buy and sell orders as most exchanges charge that amount some exchanges offer no fee trading on certain coins so be sure to look around for those so you can keep the commissions and maximize profitsi strongly encourage you to try out a lot of different setting combinations across multiple different coins and do it across a few months to see how it would have performed under various market conditions this will help you get a better idea of how much of a percentage deviation youll need to be able to cover to keep your bot running and making constant profits you can also use the deep backtesting feature of the strategy panel to see how it would have done but just beware that the info panel of the indicator will not reflect deep backtesting results only the normal backtesting rangemarketsthis backtester can be used on any market including crypto stocks forex futures you just need to make sure your base order is larger than the share price when using this on things besides cryptotimeframesthis backtester can be used on all timeframes,"{'3commasbacktester',
